 * v1.3.02 10/10/2022 Fixed errors in the coding of spells that requite a To-Hit roll 
 *                    but do damage rather than targeted magic. Changed initiative

 *                    Magic item class, and charges expended on successful hit. Fixed DB
 *                    entries that incorrectly use parentheses. Modified tableFind() to
 *                    compare field values using dbName(). Decouple AttackMaster and

 *                    Added "Looks Like" special template tag which will auto-hide an item and 
 *                    display only what it looks like until revealed. Default unknown magic item 
 *                    classes to be the same as "miscellaneous". Allow character_ids to be 
 *                    substituted for token_ids in calls to getCharacter(). Added the ability 
 *                    to alphabetise lists. Allow 'PW' to substitute 'POWER' in calls to caster() 
 *                    and related functions.

A single successful Disarm against a two-handed weapon user won\'t knock the weapon out of the wielder\'s hands; it will merely knock his weapon askew and make him take some time to recover, so he automatically loses initiative on his next round. However, two Disarm maneuvers successfully made against the character in the same round will knock the weapon loose.}}{{desc2=**Disadvantages**\nAs with single-weapon use, two-handed weapon technique has the drawback that the user cannot wear or use a shield, or gain the shield\'s AC bonus.}}{{desc3=**Style Specialization**\nYou can, by devoting a weapon proficiency to it, take a Style Specialization with Two-Hander Style.\nStyle Specialization with Two-Hander Style gives you a very specific benefit: When you\'re using a weapon two-handed, that weapon\'s Speed Factor is reduced by 3.\nThis is because when a fighter wields such a weapon with both hands on the hilt, he has more leverage on the blade and can move it faster.

First, your attack penalty drops; before, it was a –2 with your primary weapon and –4 with your secondary, but with Specialization in Two-Weapon Style it becomes 0 with your primary weapon and a –2 with your secondary weapon. (If you\'re already ambidextrous, that penalty is 0 with primary weapon and 0 with secondary weapon). Second, you\'re allowed to use weapons of the same length in each hand, so you can, for example, wield two long swords.\nWhen fighting with two-weapon technique, you can choose for both weapons to try the same maneuver (for example, two strikes, or two disarms), or can have each try a different maneuver (one strike and one parry, one pin and one strike). If the two maneuvers are to be different, each receives a –1 attack penalty. \nThough rangers don\'t suffer the off-hand penalties for two-weapons use, they do not get a bonus to attack rolls if they devote a weapon proficiency slot to Two-Weapon Style. They do get the other benefit, of being able to use weapons of equal length.}}'},

If the character is disarmed, all he has to wield offensively is his shield, until he can get back to his weapon. If he is pinned in combat, he can\'t use his shield hand for grappling.}}{{desc3=**Style Specialization**\nIf you devote a weapon proficiency slot to specialization in Weapon and Shield Style, you receive one extra attack per round . . . only when using a shield on the shield-hand, that is. You can use that extra attack only for the Shield-Punch and Parry maneuvers.\nAs with the normal "Attacking with Two Weapons" rules (see the Player\'s Handbook, page 96), when striking with both hands in a single combat round, the character suffers a –2 to attack rolls with his weapon and a –4 to attack rolls with the Shield-Punch or Parry. (If you\'re ambidextrous, as described above under "Off-Hand Weapons Use," that\'s a –2 with weapon and –2 with shield.) If you devote a second weapon proficiency slot to Weapon and Shield Style Specialization, that penalty drops to with the weapon and –2 with the shield. (If you\'re ambidextrous, that penalty is 0 with weapon and 0 with shield).\nOn any round when you perform two maneuvers, you do not get the AC bonus for the shield for the rest of the round. If you swing your sword and perform a Shield-Punch in the same round, you do not get your shield\'s AC bonus if anyone attacks you later in the round.}}'},

They patrol the deeps of oceans and large inland waters, holding court beneath the waves. Often they are only seen when they frolic with dolphins in kelp beds.\nAquatic elves have gill slits much like fish, through which they process oxygen. They can also survive out of water for a short time by breathing. Their skin is typically silvergreen, matching the seaweed near their territory. Some possess a bluish tinge to their skin, although this is quite rare. Aquatic elves\' hair complements their skin and is also green or blue-green. The overall effect is one that makes them difficult to discern underwater, especially near kelp beds. Because of their coloring, they gain the typical elven ability to camouflage themselves in their natural environment. \nThese elves dislike sharks intensely. Because they fear the strange and terrible monsters that dwell in the sea, the aquatic elves and the dolphins have taken it upon themselves to keep at least some of it safe for those who travel across it. Thus, most seaside communities severely punish those who incur the wrath of sea elves. Only the most evil of people encourage the death of sea elves and dolphins.\nAlthough they may survive on land, aquatic elves prefer not to do so, for it causes them immense pain. They can walk on land for a number of days equal to their initial Constitution score. Every two days, all their ability scores decrease by –1 until the elves return to water. If a physical score (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) reaches 0, the elf dies. In salt water, the sea elf\'s attributes return to normal within 15 minutes. In fresh water, an elf merely stops losing his or her scores; they do not revert to normal until the elf enters salt water.}}'},

The gem that most draws the interest and devotion of the Svirfneblin is the ruby, which is the predominant symbol of the race. The Deep Gnomes view these crimson stones with reverence approaching awe--so much so that they are never used for mundane practices such as ornamentation of garments, weapons, or armor. Rubies are reserved for sacred purposes and are often employed to decorate artifacts that are dedicated to the Svirfneblin gods. They are also favored by Deep Gnome monarchs, so much so that a Svirfneblin king or queen might have a full ring of rubies around his or her crown, with others of the precious stone set in the throne and sceptre.\nDeep Gnomes make and wield *stun darts*, throwing them to a range of 40 feet, with a +2 bonus to hit. Each dart releases a small puff of gas when it strikes; any creature inhaling the gas must save versus poison or be stunned for 1 round and slowed for the four following rounds.

They dwell in large swaths of woodland, and--unlike the other gnomish subraces - prefer to dwell in houses that are at least partially above ground. They are creatures of nature far more than any of their cousins, and to those rare folks who meet them (and pass through the walls of initial shyness) they can prove to be steadfast allies and delightful companions.\nHowever, this subrace has not totally abandoned the love of gemstones that is so inherent to all gnomes. The emerald is the favored gem of the Forest Gnomes, no doubt because it most accurately reflects the healthy colors of their verdant homelands. While these gnomes can make excellent gemsmiths and jewelers, their work tends to be reverent images of the flowers, leaves, butterflies, and birds that are such a key part of the Forest Gnome\'s environment.\nThey share the stocky physique of the Rock and Tinker Gnome and the bulbous nose which is so characteristic of the race in general. They are the only gnomes inclined to wear beards and hair very long, and an older male is likely to have a beard that extends to within a few inches of the ground, and hair that, when unbound, falls all the way to his waist. These beards are a source of great pride to the venerable males, and they often trim them to a fine point or curl them into hornlike spikes that extend to either side.\nShy and timid when it comes to relations with other intelligent races, Forest Gnomes are very determined caretakers of their wooded domains. They are viewed with friendship by the animals of the forest and have developed a limited language of signs and sounds (similar to the Rock Gnome\'s \'speech\' with burrowing mammals) that allows them to communicate with these creatures, though without a great deal of detail.\nForest Gnomes are also very adept at protecting and caring for the plant life of their woods. They gather the nuts, fruit, and other bounty of the woods for sustenance, taking meat only infrequently--and always with a reverent ceremony to the spirit of the animal slain by the gnomish hunter. They despise the use of traps, never employing snares, pitfalls, or such traps themselves. When they encounter such devices set by humans or others, the Forest Gnomes have been known to rig the traps so that they capture (with a snare) or injure (as with a deadfall or pit trap) the trapper when he or she comes along to check for game. Generally, the trapper receives the same effect that his or her trap would have inflicted upon an animal.\nAside from meat, Forest Gnomes eat their food raw, though with a great deal of ceremony and politeness. Even a nut or a berry is only consumed after the tree or bush that gave it life has been properly, albeit silently, thanked. Needless to say, meals among the Forest Gnomes are very long, quiet affairs.\nThe most hated enemies of the Forest Gnomes are orcs, with troglodytes and lizardmen close behind. These creatures will be ruthlessly attacked and ambushed whenever they are encountered. Despite their shyness, Forest Gnomes have made friends with elves and halflings, though they tend to distrust humans and dwarves, who in their experience all-too-often view trees only as so much firewood.}}'},

They live in abandoned strongholds, human villages, or in old mines and caves, in sewers, refuse dumps, or the slums of larger towns and cities. Elves will not tolerate their depravity.\nAn average gully dwarf is more slender than hill or mountain dwarves and has thin fingers. It is a status symbol for a gully dwarf to have a large pot belly for it displays his skill as a scavenger.\nSkin ranges in color from olive brown to light yellow, reminiscent of old parchment. It is often hard to determine a gully dwarf\'s skin color, however, because of the thick layers of dirt, scar tissue, boils, and scabs covering his skin.\nTheir beards and hair range from a dirty blond to a dull, indeterminate color. Female gully dwarves have hairy cheeks, but no beards. The eyes of both sexes are dull and lifeless, varying in color from watery blue through green to hazel.\nGullys are renowned for being stupid and obnoxious. A player character gully dwarf is an exception to the rule, being superior to others of his kind by virtue of his ability to think. However, players should not abuse this ability and allow their characters to concoct clever plans and schemes. Intelligence checks may be requested to see if the character could actually come up with such ideas. \nThey have high opinions of themselves and take themselves very seriously. They consider other dwarves to be "uppity" and "stuck up warts." Gully dwarves will lie, steal, bully, and cheat each other and every other race they encounter. If attacked, they grovel (see the power), whine, run away, or do whatever it takes to avoid injury. If combat cannot be avoided they will fight halfheartedly, usually with their eyes closed.\nBecause gully dwarves live in places that even orcs consider unattractive, they have few racial enemies. Scavenging most of their equipment from the junk heaps of other races, their "wealth" does not tempt others. Carrion crawlers have been known to turn up their tentacles rather than eat a gully dwarf.\nWhere do they come from? Other dwarves claim they are a cruel jest played by the gods on a mischievous stronghold of dwarves. Narvil believes that they are outcasts from a stronghold who later bred and infested the world. Perhaps they are the result of cross breeding between dwarves and gnomes, or dwarves and goblins. They may even have been the result of a vile experiment by an evil wizard. No one knows for sure, least of all the gullys themselves.\nThey are always treated with contempt, although they may be employed to perform menial tasks. Enclaves of gully dwarves could exist in most strongholds where they would be little better than slaves.\nGully dwarves are often of chaotic neutral alignment, but this diverse people may be of any alignment.}}'},

Military and defensive alliances between the two races are common, and prosperous trading is also the norm. They are the only halflings with any affinity to mining, but they are quite good at it and will often develop a bustling business from the excavation of minerals. Stouts can also be skilled jewelers, stone-masons, builders, smiths, boatmen, and carvers.

Finding no safe haven underground, they were forced above.

A sundered dwarf must roll a successful saving throw vs. death in order to overcome his fear of the underground before he can enter dungeons, caves, and tombs. If the check fails, he may not enter. Once underground he must make a saving throw each day. If he fails, he will want to leave the underground by the most direct route. \nUnderground, a sundered dwarf attacks with a -2 penalty to his rolls. Should he fail his claustrophobic saving throw, the penalty increases by -1 for each additional day he stays underground. If he fails to reach open air, he may attempt further saving throws each day to overcome his claustrophobia. These saving throws are made at the same penalty as the dwarf\'s current attack roll penalty.\nSundered dwarves may be found living among other races.

In truth, they are no more evil than their more numerous cousins; their sinister reputation is merely the result of ignorance. The Deep Gnomes are the most reticent of all the gnomish subraces, surviving in an extremely hostile environment entirely by their own wiles.\nUnlike their Rock Gnome cousins, they have no friendly neighbors to ally themselves with, forcing them to become entirely selfreliant. Only the few who have won their trust know that they are in many ways as social and artistic as other gnomes.\nWhy do they endure this frankly hostile environment?

The gem that most draws the interest and devotion of the Svirfneblin is the ruby, which is the predominant symbol of the race. The Deep Gnomes view these crimson stones with reverence approaching awe--so much so that they are never used for mundane practices such as ornamentation of garments, weapons, or armor. Rubies are reserved for sacred purposes and are often employed to decorate artifacts that are dedicated to the Svirfneblin gods. They are also favored by Deep Gnome monarchs, so much so that a Svirfneblin king or queen might have a full ring of rubies around his or her crown, with others of the precious stone set in the throne and sceptre.\nSvirfneblin make and wield *stun darts*, throwing them to a range of 40 feet, with a +2 bonus to hit.

Their lives are geared toward the simple matter of survival in the woodlands, rather than enjoyment. Yet sylvan elves find that this life, more than anything else, gives them their greatest pleasure. Not for them the sophistication of art and delicate music. They prefer a simpler life. Their music is that of wind through leaves, the howl of wolves, and the cries of birds. Their art—in the form of tattoos—is inspired by the everchanging cycle of seasons.\nWood elves, by their very nature, seem more prone to violence than their civilized cousins. Their muscles are larger, their complexions more florid.\nSylvan elves are an independent folk and do not lightly brook intruders into their forests. Anyone, even another elf, who even draws near to a wood elf encampment (within three miles) will have a constant, unseen escort of at least two wood elves (possibly more) until the intruder leaves the area. Unless the camp is directly threatened, the wood elves will leave the intruder strictly alone. Twenty-five percent of the time wood elves will allow trespassers to know that they are being watched.\nIf those encroaching the encampment draw too near and evince hostile intent, the wood elves have no compunctions about utterly destroying them. Wood elves are extraordinarily reclusive—even more so than grey elves. They have no wish to let others expose them or their lifestyle to the harsh scrutiny of the civilized world. Therefore, they may even destroy those who bear the wood elves no particular ill will. They feel this is the only way to ensure their lives and privacy.\nAbove all, wood elves never try to leave their forests. They withdrew into the woods to escape the outer world, and whenever they leave they rediscover why they withdrew in the first place. Wood elves take a dim view of those who try to forcibly remove them. In general, wood elves are unfriendly and unhelpful. Any wood elf PC who is friendly to people he or she has just met (within the past five years or so) should be docked experience points for bad role-playing!\nFinally, wood elves have an aversion to most settings that are not of the woods. They hate the sea (although they can travel on lakes) and will not willingly board a seagoing ship. They hate the underground and become claustrophobic beneath the soil. These elves are even worse in the cities and lands of other races, including those of other elves. Sylvan elves regard cities as a perversion. They cannot deal with technology and civilization, for it was civilization that drove the wood elves into their isolation.}}'},

However, whereas the other subraces seek gems, the Tinkers hold a different substance as the grandest rock of all: coal. The Tinkers hold that coal (also known as the "Father of Steam") is the most valuable substance of the world, and those places where it can be mined quickly become Tinker Gnome warrens.\nIn size and stature, the Tinkers resemble Rock Gnomes--so much so that the difference is not immediately apparent, at least when based only upon appearance.\nTinkers who live out their lives can attain an age of 250 or 300 years, but it must be noted that this is a rare occurrence among the members of this subrace. If one of his or her own inventions doesn\'t do a Tinker in, chances are good that one of his or her neighbor\'s gadgets will.\nEven in childhood, Tinkers are encouraged to experiment with gadgets and gimmicks, trying different means of making things to perform tasks that could otherwise be easily done by hand. The Tinker reaches adulthood at about the age of fifty (by which time perhaps 10-15% of them have already succumbed to the common fate of their kind). Despite this high attrition, it\'s not until maturity that a Tinker Gnome\'s activities begin to get really dangerous.\nUpon reaching adulthood, the Tinker Gnome must select a guild for himself or herself. The number of guilds available varies by location, but in Mount Nevermind on Krynn--which is the center of Tinker civilization and by far the largest community of these inventive creatures anywhere--there are more than 150 active guilds. These include virtually all areas of practical endeavor, and quite a few impractical ones as well.\nAfter selecting a guild, each member of the subrace settles upon a Life-quest. The actual choice of the quest may take several decades, but once it has been decided, it becomes the reason behind that Tinker\'s existence. The Lifequest is an attempt to reach a perfect understanding of some device (anything from a spelljamming helm to a screw), a task at which the Tinker very rarely succeeds. Indeed, the best estimate is that less than 1% of these gnomes ever do fully grasp the nature of the object that has occupied their attention for so much of their adult lives; the rest of these easily-distracted gnomes get hopelessly sidetracked somewhere along the way.\nDespite the vagaries of their existence, the Tinkers are a fun-loving and generally sociable race. Their speech is unique in both its speed and complexity. Two Tinkers can rattle off information and opinion to each other in a succession of thousand-word sentences, speaking simultaneously and yet listening and understanding (as much as is possible, given the esoteric nature of many discussions) each other even as they voice their own points of view. Those Tinkers who have had some experience interacting with other races have learned to slow the pace of their communication but never quite overcome their frustration with those who can\'t talk and listen at the same time.}}'},

In fact, the air elemental\'s mastery of its natural element gives it a strong advantage in combat above the ground.

They like dismal surroundings, heavy vegetation, and prefer darkness to daylight. Although not as intelligent as other dragons, black dragons are instinctively cunning and malevolent.\nAt birth, a black dragon\'s scales are thin, small, and glossy. But as the dragon ages, its scales become larger, thicker, and duller, which helps it camouflage itself in swamps and marshes.\nBlack dragons are found in swamps, marshes, rain forests, and jungles. They revel in a steamy environment where canopies of trees filter out most of the sunlight, swarms of insects fill the air, and stagnant moss-covered ponds lie in abundance. Black dragons are excellent swimmers and enjoy lurking in the gloomy depths of swamps and bogs. They also are graceful in flight; however, they prefer to fly at night when their great forms are hidden by the darkness of the sky. Black dragons are extremely selfish, and the majority of those encountered will be alone. When a family of black dragons is encountered, the adults will protect their young. However, if it appears the adults\' lives are in jeopardy they will abandon their young to save themselves.\nThey lair in large, damp caves and multi-chambered subterranean caverns. Older dragons are able to hide the entrance to their lairs with their plant growth ability. Black dragons are especially fond of coins. Older black dragons sometimes capture and question humans, before killing them, to find out where stockpiles of gold, silver, and platinum coins are kept.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their surroundings as cover. Their favorite targets are men, who they will sometimes stalk for several minutes in an attempt to gauge their strength and wealth before attacking. Against a band of men or a formidable creature, of the marsh can weaken the targets before the dragon joins the fight. Black dragons will also use their breath weapon before closing in melee. When fighting in heavily vegetated swamps and marshes, black dragons attempt to stay in the water or along the ground; the numerous trees and leafy canopies limit their flying maneuverability. When faced with an opponent which poses too much of a threat, a black dragon will attempt to fly out of sight, so it will not leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog.}}'},

They love to spend long hours preparing ambushes for herd animals and unwary travelers, and they spend equally long hours dwelling on their success and admiring their trophies.\nThe size of a blue dragon\'s scales increases little as the dragon ages, although they do become thicker and harder. The scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, retaining a glossy finish through all of the dragon\'s stages because the blowing desert sands polish them. This makes blue dragons easy to spot in barren desert surroundings. However, the dragons often conceal themselves, burrowing into the sand so only part of their heads are exposed.\nBlue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air; usually flying in the daytime when temperatures are the highest. Some blue dragons nearly match the color of the desert sky and use this coloration to their advantage in combat.\nBlue dragons are found in deserts; arid, windswept plains; and hot humid badlands. They enjoy the bleak terrain because there are few obstacles-only an occasional rock outcropping or dune-to interrupt the view of their territories. They spend hours looking out over their domains, watching for trespassers and admiring their property. Most of the blue dragons encountered will be alone because they do not want to share their territories with others. However, when a family is encountered the male dragon will attack ferociously, protecting his property-his mate and young. The female dragon also will join in the attack if the threat proves significant.\nBlue dragons\' enemies are men, who kill the dragons for their skin and treasure, and brass dragons, which share the same environment. If a blue dragon discovers a brass dragon in the same region, it will not rest until the trespassing dragon is killed or driven away.\nBlue dragons lair in vast underground caverns in which they store their treasure. Although blue dragons will collect anything which looks valuable, they are fond of gems - especially sapphires.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Blue dragons prefer to fight from a distance so their opponents can clearly witness the full force of their breath weapon and so little or no threat is posed to themselves. Often blue dragons will attack from directly above or will burrow beneath the sands until opponents come within 100 feet. Older blue dragons will use their special abilities, such as hallucinatory terrain, in concert with these tactics to mask the land and aid in their chances to surprise. Blue dragons will only run from a fight if they are severely damaged, since they view retreat as cowardly.}}'},

Their color is a brassy, mottled brown. As the dragon gets older, the scales become more brassy, until they reach a warm burnished appearance.\nBrass dragons are found in arid, warm climates; ranging from sandy deserts to dry steppes. They love intense, dry heat and spend most of their time basking in the sun. They lair in high caves, preferably facing east where the sun can warm the rocks, and their territories always contain several spots where they can bask and trap unwary travelers into conversation.\nBrass dragons are very social. They usually are on good terms with neighboring brass dragons and sphinxes. Brass dragons are dedicated parents. If their young are attacked they will try to slay the enemy, using their heat breath weapons and taking full advantage of their own immunity. Because they share the same habitat, blue dragons are brass dragons\' worst enemies. Brass dragons usually get the worst of a one-on-one confrontation, mostly because of the longer reach of the blue dragon\'s breath weapon. Because of this, brass dragons usually try to evade blue dragons until they can rally their neighbors for a mass attack.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Brass dragons would rather talk than fight. If an intelligent creature tries to take its leave of a brass dragon without talking to it at length, the dragon might have a fit of pique and try to force a conversation with suggestion or by giving the a dose of sleep gas. If the victim falls asleep it will awaken to find itself pinned under the dragon or buried to the neck in the sand until the dragon\'s thirst for small talk is slaked. Before melee, brass dragons create a cloud of dust with dust devil or control winds, then charge or snatch. Brass dragons often use control temperature to create heat to discomfort their opponents. When faced with real danger, younger brass dragons will fly out of sight, then hide by burrowing. Older dragons spurn this ploy.}}'},

Bronze dragons thrive on simple challenges such as riddles and harmless contests. They are fascinated by warfare and will eagerly join an army if the cause is just and the pay is good.\nAt birth, a bronze dragon\'s scales are yellow tinged with green, showing only a hint of bronze. As the dragon approached adulthood, its color deepens slowly changing to a rich bronze tone that gets darker as the dragon ages. Dragons from the very old stage on develop a blue-black tint to the edges of their scales, similar to a patina on ancient bronze armor or statues.\nBronze dragons like to be near deep fresh or salt water. They are good swimmers and often visit the depths to cool off or to hunt for pearls or treasure from sunken ships. They prefer caves that are accessible only from the water, but their lairs are always dry--they do not lay eggs, sleep, or store treasure under water.\nBronze dragons are fond of sea mammals, especially dolphins and whales. These animals provide the dragons with a wealth of information on shipwrecks, which the dragons love to plunder, and detail the haunts of large sharks. Bronze dragons detest pirates, disabling or destroying their ships.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Bronze dragons dislike killing creatures with animal intelligence and would rather bribe them (perhaps with food), or force them away with repulsion. When confronted with intelligent opponents bronze dragons use their ESP ability to learn their opponents\' intentions. When attacking they blind their opponents with wall of fog, then charge. Or, if they are flying they will snatch opponents. When fighting under water, they use airy water to maintain the effectiveness of their breath weapons, and to keep away purely aquatic opponents. Against boats or ship they summon a storm or use their tail slap to smash the vessels\' hulls. If the dragon is inclined to be lenient, seafaring opponents might merely find themselves becalmed, fog bound, or with broken masts.}}'},

They dwell in remote, secluded glades and pastures.\nThe appearance of a centaur is unmistakable: they have the upper torso, arms, and head of a human being and the lower body of a large, powerful horse.\nCentaurs are sociable creatures, taking great pleasure in the society of others of their kind. Their overall organization is tribal, with a tribe divided into family groups living together in harmony. The size of the tribe varies, it range from 3-4 families to upwards of 20 families. Since males have the dangerous roles of hunter and protector, females outnumber males by two to one. The centaur mates for life, and the entire tribe participates in the education of the young.\nThe lair is located deep within a forest, and consists of a large, hidden glade and pasture with a good supply of running water. Depending upon the climate, the lair may contain huts or lean-tos to shelter the individual families. Centaurs are skilled in horticulture, and have been known to cultivate useful plants in the vicinity of their lair. In dangerous, monster infested areas, centaurs will sometimes plant a thick barrier of tough thorn bushes around their lair and even set traps and snares. In the open area, away from the trees, are hearths for cooking and warmth. If encountered in their lair, there will be 1-6 additional males, females equal to twice the number of males, and 5-30 young. The females (3 Hit Dice) and the young (1-3 Hit Dice) will fight only with their hooves, and only in a life or death situation.\nCentaurs survive through a mixture of hunting, foraging, fishing, agriculture and trade. Though they shun dealings with humans, centaurs have been known to trade with elves, especially for food and wine. The elves are paid from the group treasury, which comes from the booty of slain monsters. \nThe territory of a centaur tribe varies with its size and the nature of the area it inhabits. Centaurs are also not above sharing a territory with elves.\nCentaurs will take the treasure of their fallen foes, and are fully aware of its value. Most male centaurs have a small coin supply, while the tribe has a treasury which may well include some magical items. This treasure is used to buy food for the group, or to ransom (90% likely) captured or threatened members of the tribe.\nWhile basically neutral or chaotic good, centaurs have been known to become rowdy, boorish, and aggressive when under the influence of alcohol. They are also extremely protective of their females and young. Centaurs are basically pastoral, but will react with violence if their lifestyle and survival is threatened.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** A band of centaurs is always armed. Half of the centaurs will be wielding oaken clubs (the equivalent of morning stars), one quarter will carry composite bows and have 10-30 arrows (either flight or sheaf, depending on the current state of affairs in the area). The remainder of the band will be leaders. Centaurs make 3 attacks each round in melee: once with their weapons and twice with their hooves.\nThe attitude of a centaur toward a stranger in its territory will vary with the visitor. Humans and dwarves will usually be asked to leave in a polite manner, while halflings or gnomes will be tolerated, and elves will be welcomed. Monsters will be dealt with in a manner according to the threat they represent to the welfare and survival of the tribe. Were a giant or dragon to enter the territory, the centaurs would pull up stakes and relocate, while trolls and orcs and their like will be killed.}}'},

Female cloud giants can be 1 to 2 feet shorter and 1,000 to 2,000 pounds lighter. Cloud giants\' skin ranges in color from a milky-white tinged with blue to a light sky blue. Their hair is silvery white or brass and their eyes are an iridescent blue.\nCloud giants dress in clothing made of the finest materials available and wear jewelry. Many of the giants consider their appearance an indication of their station; the more jewelry and the better the clothes, the more important the giant. Cloud giants also appreciate music, and the majority of giants are able to play one or more instruments (their favorite is the harp). Unlike most other giant races, cloud giants leave their treasure in their lairs, carrying with them only food, throwing rocks, 10-100 (10d10) coins, and a musical instrument.\nCloud giants live in small clans of no more than six giants. However, these clans know the location of 1-8 other clans and will band together with some of these clans for celebrations, battles, or to trade. These joined clans will recognize one among them to be their leader -- this is usually an older cloud giant who has magical abilities. One in 10 cloud giants will have spells equivalent to a 4th level wizard, and one in 20 cloud giants will be the equivalent of a 4th level priest. A cloud giant cannot have both priest and wizard abilities.\nThe majority of cloud giants live on cloud-covered mountain peaks in temperate and sub-tropical areas. These giants make their lairs in crude castles.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Cloud giants fight in well-organized units, using carefully developed battle plans. They prefer to fight from a position above their opponents. A favorite tactic is to circle the enemy, barraging them with rocks while the giants with magical abilities assault them with spells. Cloud giants can hurl rocks to a maximum of 240 yards, causing 2-24 (2d12) points of damage. Their huge morningstars do 6-24 (6d4)+11 points of damage, three times normal (man-sized) damage plus their strength bonus. One in 10 cloud giants will have a magical weapon.}}'},

They are as elusive as they are alluring, however, and dryads are rarely seen unless taken by surprise - or they wish to be spotted.\nThe dryad\'s exquisite features, delicate and finely chiseled, are much like an elf maiden\'s. Dryads have high cheek bones and amber, violet, or dark green eyes. A dryad\'s complexion and hair color changes with the seasons, presenting the sprite with natural camouflage. During the fall, a dryad\'s hair turns golden or red, and her skin subtly darkens from its usual light tan to more closely match her hair color.\nThis enables her to blend with the falling leaves of autumn. In winter, both the dryad\'s hair and skin are white, like the snows that cover the oak groves. When encountered in a forest during fall or winter, a dryad is often mistaken for an attractive maid, probably of elvish descent. No one would mistake a dryad for an elf maid during the spring and summer, however. At these times of year, a dryad\'s skin is lightly tanned and her hair is green like the oak leaves around her.\nDryads often appear clothed in a loose, simple garment. The clothing they wear is the color of the oak grove in the season they appear.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Dryads are shy, nonviolent creatures. They rarely carry weapons, but they sometimes carry knives as tools. Though a dryad can use this as a weapon in a fight, she will not resort to using a knife unless seriously threatened.\nDryads have the ability to throw a powerful charm person spell three times a day (but only once per round). This spell is so powerful that targets of the spell suffer a -3 penalty to their saving throws. A Dryad always uses this spell if seriously threatened, attempting to gain control of the attacker who could help her most against his comrades. Dryads will only attempt to charm elves as a last resort because of their natural resistance to this type of spell.\nThe dryad\'s use of her ability to charm is not limited to combat situations, however. Whenever a dryad encounters a male with a Charisma of 16 or more, she usually tries to charm him. Charismatic victims of a dryad\'s attentions are taken to the tree sprite\'s home, where the men serve as amorous slaves to their beautiful captors. There is a 50% chance that a person charmed and taken away by a dryad will never\nreturn. If he does escape from the dryad\'s charms, it will be after 1d4 years of captivity.\nThis tree sprite also has two other powers that are very useful in defense. Unless surprised, a dryad has the ability to literally step through a tree and then dimension door to the oak tree she is part of. She can also speak with plants (as the 4th-level priest spell). This enables the dryad to gather information about parties traveling near her tree, and even to use vegetation to hinder potential attackers.}}'},

An earth elemental can travel through solid ground or stone with no penalty to movement or dexterity.

For example, a reinforced door, which might require a few rounds to shatter using conventional methods, can be smashed with ease by an earth elemental. They can even level a small cottage in a few rounds.\nAn earth elemental\'s effectiveness against creatures in the air or water is limited; the damage done by the elemental\'s fists on airborne or waterborne targets is lessened by 2 points per die (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die).}}'},

On closer inspection, however, the creature\'s vast differences from the relatively civilized giant races become readily apparent. An ettin has pink to brownish skin, though it appears to be covered in a dark brown hide. This is because an ettin never bathes if it can help it, and is therefore usually encrusted with a thick layer of dirt and grime. Its skin is thick, giving the ettin its low Armor Class. An ettin\'s hair is long, stringy, and unkempt; its teeth are large, yellowing, and often rotten. The ettin\'s facial features strongly resemble those of an orc -- large watery eyes, turned-up piggish snout, and large mouth.\nAn ettin\'s right head is always the dominant one, and the right arm and leg will likely appear slightly more muscular and well-developed than the left. An ettin wears only rough, untreated skins, which are dirty and unwashed. Obviously, ettins smell very bad, due to their complete lack of grooming habits -- good or bad.\n**Habitat:** Ettins like to establish their lairs in remote, rocky areas. They dwell in dark, underground caves that stink of decaying food and offal. Ettins are generally solitary, and mated pairs only stay together for a few months after a young ettin is born to them. Young ettins mature very quickly, and within eight to ten months after they are born, they are self-sufficient enough to go off on their own.\nOn rare occasions, however, a particularly strong ettin may gather a small group of 1d4 ettins together. This small band of ettins stays together only as long as the leader remains alive and undefeated in battle. Any major defeat shatters the leader\'s hold over the band, and they each go their separate ways. \nEttins collect treasure only because it can buy them the services of goblins or orcs. These creatures sometimes serve ettins by building traps around their lairs, or helping to fight off a powerful opponent. Ettins have also been known to occasionally keep 1-2 cave bears in the area of their lairs.\nThe sloppy caves of ettins are a haven for parasites and vermin, and it isn\'t unusual for the ettins themselves to be infected with various parasitic diseases. Adventurers rummaging through ettin lairs for valuables will find the task disgusting, if not dangerous.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Though ettins have a low intelligence, they are cunning fighters. They prefer to ambush their victims rather than charge into a straight fight, but once the battle has started, ettins usually fight furiously until all enemies are dead, or the battle turns against them. Ettins do not retreat easily, only doing so if victory is impossible.}}'},

To provide a fire elemental with an adequate shell of Prime Material flame, a fire built to house an elemental should have a diameter of at least six feet and reach a minimum of four feet into the air. On the Prime Material Plane, a fire elemental appears as a tall sheet of flame.\nThe fire elemental will always appear to have two armlike appendages, one on each side of its body. These arms seem to flicker back into the creature\'s flaming body, only to spring out from its sides seconds later. The only facial features of a fire elemental are two large glowing patches of brilliant blue fire, which seem to function as eyes for the elemental}}{{desc1=Because they resent being conjured to this plane, fire elementals are fierce opponents who will attack their enemies directly and savagely, taking what joy they can in burning the weak creatures and objects of the Prime Material to ashes. In combat, a fire elemental lashes out with one of its ever-moving limbs, doing 3-24 points of damage. Any flammable object struck by the fire elemental must save versus magical fire at a -2 or immediately begin to burn.\nFire elementals do have some limitations on their actions in the Prime Material plane. They are unable to cross water or non-flammable liquids. Often, a quick dive into a nearby lake or stream is the only thing that can save a powerful party from certain death from a fire elemental. Also, because their natural abilities give them some built-in resistance to flame-based attacks, creatures with innate fire-using abilities, like red dragons, take less damage from a fire elemental\'s attack. The elemental subtracts 1 point from each die of damage it does to these creature (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die)}}'},

A typical frost giant\'s sack contains 2-5 (1d4+1) throwing rocks, the giant\'s wealth, and 3-12 (3d4) mundane items.

One of their favorite strategies is to ambush victims by hiding buried in the snow at the top of an icy or snowy slope where opponents will have difficulty reaching them.\nWarriors favor huge battle axes. A frost giant\'s oversized weapons do double normal (man-sized) damage to all opponents, plus the giant\'s strength bonus. Thus, a frost giant battle axe does 2-16 (2d8) +9 points of damage.\nAdult frost giants can hurl rocks for 2-20 (2d10) points of damage.

The flecks get larger as the dragon matures until, at the adult stage, the scales grow completely golden.\nGold dragons can live anywhere. Their lairs are secluded and always made of solid stone, either caves or castles. These usually have loyal guards: either animals appropriate to the terrain, or storm or good cloud giants. The giants usually serve as guards through a mutual defensive agreement.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Gold dragons usually parley before combat. When conversing with intelligent creatures they use *detect lie* and *detect gems* spells to gain the upper hand. In combat, they quickly use *bless* and *luck bonus*.

They hate goodness and good-aligned creatures. They love intrigue and seek to enslave other woodland creatures, killing those who cannot be controlled or intimidated.\nA hatchling green dragon\'s scales are thin, very small, and a deep shade of green that appears nearly black. As the dragon ages, the scales grow larger and become lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green, which helps it blend in with its wooded surroundings. A green dragon\'s scales never become as thick as other dragons\', remaining smooth and flexible.\nGreen dragons are found in sub-tropical and temperate forests, the older the forest and bigger the trees, the better. The sights and smells of the woods are pleasing to the dragon, and it considers the entire forest or woods its territory. Sometimes the dragon will enter into a relationship with other evil forest-dwelling creatures, which keep the dragon informed about what is going on in the forest and surrounding area in exchange for their lives. If a green dragon lives in a forest on a hillside, it will seek to enslave hill giants, which the dragon considers its greatest enemy. A green dragon makes its lair in underground chambers far beneath its forest.\nThe majority of green dragons encountered will be alone. However, when a mated pair of dragons and their young are encountered, the female will leap to the attack. The male will take the young to a place of safety before joining the fight. The parents are extremely protective of their young, despite their evil nature, and will sacrifice their own lives to save their offspring.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Green dragons initiate fights with little or no provocation, picking on creatures of any size. If the target creature intrigues the dragon or appears to be difficult to deal with, the dragon will stalk the creature, using its environment for cover, until it determines the best time to strike and the most appropriate tactics to use. If the target appears formidable, the dragon will first attack with its breath weapon, magical abilities, and spells. However, if the target appears weak, the dragon will make its presence known quickly for it enjoys evoking terror in its targets. When the dragon has tired of this game, it will bring down the creature using its physical attacks so the fight lasts longer and the creature\'s agony is prolonged.\nSometimes, the dragon elects to control a creature, such as a human or demi-human, through intimidation and suggestion. Green dragons like to question men, especially adventurers, to learn more about their society, abilities, what is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasure nearby.}}'},

The equine section is covered with short hair. The mane is made of long, flexible fins. The front hooves are replaced by webbed fins that fold up as the leg moves forward, then fan out as the leg strokes back. Past the rib cage the body becomes fish-like. The tail tapers 14 feet into a wide horizontal fin. A dorsal fin is located on the rump. Coloration is that of seawater. Typical colors include ivory, pale green, pale blue, aqua, deep blue, and deep green.\nHippocampi are the prized steeds of the sea. They can be found in deep waters anywhere, in freshwater lakes and oceans. They are able to breathe fresh and salt water with equal ease. They can also breathe air but require frequent gulps of water to keep from drying out. They are unable to\nmove out of water.\nDespite their radically different environments, horses and hippocampi are very similar. They have approximately the same sizes, life spans, and personalities, although hippocampi are blessed with much higher intelligence.\nHippocampi may be "domesticated" by water-breathing humanoids, especially tritons. In truth, the intelligent hippocampi cooperate with the humanoids. The hippocampi provide their services as steeds and allies while the humanoids provide protection. The benevolent hippocampi may assist surface dwellers who are visiting the aquatic world, whether voluntarily or by accident. Many a shipwrecked sailor has been saved from drowning by a passing hippocampus. Hippocampi are good judges of character; they will not assist an evil being or anyone who acts in a hostile manner toward them. Sometimes a hippocampus\'s offer of a ride can be more trouble than it is worth. Young hippocampi often forget that most surface dwellers breathe air, not water.\nHippocampi do not accumulate treasure. Most spurn even ornamental gifts such as collars or leg bands. They simply have no use for these gewgaws. They do appreciate delicacies, however, in the forms of tasty foods not available in the water.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Hippocampi are usually peaceful creatures. They do not attack unless cornered or if another hippocampus or an ally is threatened. They are fast enough to out-swim most anything that would want to attack them.\nThe hippocampus attacks with a strong bite. It suddenly extends its head, chomps down with a crushing bite, and then releases. Hippocampi do not hold onto their opponents. Hippocampi also butt their heads against targets. Such attacks may stun an opponent or break his bones.\nTheir firm, powerfully muscled bodies provide a strong protection against attack. The blood coagulates quickly on exposure to water, thus minimizing blood loss that could both debilitate the hippocampus and attract sharks (sharks have only a 20% chance of going into a feeding frenzy if the only bleeding creature is a hippocampus).}}'},

Hippogriffs may, in the absence of other meat, attack small groups of people. Bodies are then carried back to the nest to feed the others; this is where the victim\'s possessions usually spill out.

An invisible stalker may look for a loop hole in the command as a means of striking back at its master.

They are faultless trackers who can detect any trail less than a day old. If ordered to attack, they will do so with great fury and will cease their efforts only upon their own destruction or the direct orders of their master. Once their mission is accomplished, the creature is free to return to its home plane.\nThe true form of the invisible stalker is unknown. On the Material, Astral, or Ethereal planes, the invisible stalker can only be perceived as a shimmering air mass which looks much like the refraction effect caused by hot air passing in front of cold.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Invisible stalkers attack by using the air itself as a weapon.

When a victim falls afoul of a trap, the jermlaine swarm over him. Some pummel him with blackjacks while others tie him with ropes and cords. Such beatings have a cumulative 2% chance per blow of causing the victim to lapse into unconsciousness. If a victim is wearing splint, banded, or plate mail, these pummeling attacks are ineffective.

They especially dislike gnomes and attack them on sight. Barely clearing 3 feet in height, kobolds have scaly hides that range from dark, rusty brown to a rusty black. They smell of damp dogs and stagnant water. Their eyes glow like a bright red spark and they have two small horns ranging from tan to white. Because of the kobolds\' fondness for wearing raggedy garb of red and orange, their non-prehensile rat-like tails, and their language (which sounds like small dogs yapping), these fell creatures are often not taken seriously. This is often a fatal mistake, for what they lack in size and strength they make up in ferocity and tenacity}}{{desc1=**Combat:** The kobold approach to combat uses overwhelming odds or trickery. Kobolds will attack gnomes on sight, but will think twice about attacking humans, elves, or dwarves unless the kobolds outnumber them by at least two to one. They often hurl javelins and spears, preferring not to close until they see that their enemies have been weakened.\nKobolds attack in overwhelming waves. Should the kobolds be reduced to only a three to two ratio in their favor, they must make a morale check. Kobolds are wary of spellcasters and will aim for them when possible.\nThis diminutive race also enjoys setting up concealed pits with spikes, crossbows, and other mechanical traps. They usually have view ports and murder holes near these traps so that they can pour flaming oil, missile weapons, or drop poisonous insects on their victims.\nKobold war bands are armed with spiked clubs, axes, javelins, short swords and spears. Their shields are seldom metal, but are normally wood or wicker. Chiefs and guards tend to have the best weapons available.\nKobolds have 60-foot infravision but do not see well in bright sunlight, suffering a -1 on their attack rolls.}}'},

The touch of a lava mephit automatically melts or burns most materials. The rate of this destruction varies from one hour to burn through an inch of wood to three rounds to completely melt plate armor.\nTheir breath weapon is a molten blob of lava usable once every three melee rounds. This blob automatically hits one target within 10 feet of the breathing mephit (1d6 points of damage, no saving throw). A lava mephit may use this weapon a maximum of eight times, after that, the mephit must recharge by soaking in a lava pool for one hour. Mephits may recharge during battle, if they come in contact with lava during combat, they regenerate 2 hit points per melee round. This ability is, of course, lost if the mephit is brought to 0 hit points or less, at this point the mephit is dead.

In either case, the clothes will be tattered and rotting with a 25% chance of being magical in some way.}}{{desc1=**Combat:** Although a lich will seldom engage in actual melee combat with those it considers enemies, it is more than capable of holding its own when forced into battle.\nThe aura of magical power which surrounds a lich is so potent that any creature of fewer than 5 Hit Dice (or 5th level) which sees it must save vs. spell or flee in terror for 5-20 (5d4) rounds.\nShould the lich elect to touch a living creature, its aura of absolute cold will inflict 1-10 points of damage. Further, the victim must save vs. paralysis or be utterly unable to move. This paralysis lasts until *dispelled* in some manner.\nPriests of at least 8th level can attempt to turn a lich, as can paladins of no less than 10th level. \nA lich is able to employ spells just as it did in life. It still requires the use of its spell books, magical components, and similar objects. It is important to note that most, if not all, liches have had a great deal of time in which to research and create new magical spells and objects.}}'},

Locathan coral carvings and jewelry are highly valued by art collectors and are traded for forged metals, ceramics, and durable magical items. Locathah can be hired to assist travelers in their realm.

Locathah only battle to the death if cornered or if their home is threatened.\nLocathah always try to recover captive locathah or their bodies.

The skin of an ogrillon of either type is covered with small horn plates, giving it a superior Armor Class and enabling it to fight without weapons.

An ogrillon out of combat is restless and troubled, but it will be seen chuckling merrily to itself during a good fight. Because of their single-mindedness, ogrillons are often approached by orcs when they need good fighters against some enemy. Ogrillons are happy to join and fight, sometimes for the love of combat and destruction, but often for more lucky gold pieces. In combat, there is only a 10% chance that a typical ogrillon can be distinguished from an orc. Ogrillons that resemble ogres, of course, clearly stand out. Ogrillons are the issue of a female orc mated with a male ogre. Thankfully, it is sterile. The union of a male orc and a female ogre yields an orog, a better class of humanoid monster}}'},

In general, they resemble primitive humans with grey-green skin covered with coarse hair. Orcs have a slightly stooped posture, a low jutting forehead, and a snout instead of a nose, though comparisons between this facial feature and those of pigs are exaggerated and perhaps unfair. Orcs have well-developed canine teeth for eating meat and short pointed ears that resemble those of a wolf. Orcish snouts and ears have a slightly pink tinge. Their eyes are human, with a reddish tint that sometimes makes them appear to glow red when they reflect dim light sources in near darkness. This is actually part of their optical system, a pigment which gives them infravision.}}{{desc1=**Combat:** Orcs are constantly in battle.

Piercers can hear noises and detect heat sources in a 120-yard radius; these heat sources include humans. If the noise and light are stationary for many minutes at a time, piercers will slowly edge into attack position over the source of the stimulus. Piercers are virtually indistinguishable from natural phenomena. A group of characters has a -7 modifier on its surprise roll against a piercer (this guarantees that the group will be surprised unless it has some positive modifiers).\nA piercer, after it has fallen, is slow and fairly easily slain. Its soft underbelly has one defense mechanism; when exposed to air it covers itself in a corrosive acid which inflicts 1 point of damage on contact with flesh. This is usually enough to dissuade natural predators from disturbing it.}}'},

They are known and feared for their size, physical prowess, and magical abilities. The oldest dragons are among the most powerful creatures in the world. \nMost dragons are identified by the color of their scales. All subspecies of dragons have 12 age categories, and gain more abilities and greater power as they age. Dragons range in size from several feet upon hatching to more than 100 feet, after they have attained the status of great wyrm. The exact size varies according to age and subspecies. A dragon\'s wingspan is about equal to its body length; 15-20% of a dragon\'s body length is neck.\nDragons, especially older ones, are generally solitary due to necessity and preference. They distance themselves from civilization, which they consider to be a petty and foolish mortal invention. Dragons are fearsome predators, but scavenge when necessary and can eat almost anything if they are hungry enough. A dragon\'s metabolism operates like a highly efficient furnace, making use of 95% of all the food the dragon eats. A dragon can also metabolize inorganic material, and some dragons have developed a taste for such fare.\nAlthough dragons\' goals and ideals vary among subspecies, all dragons are covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and gathering as many gems, jewels, and magical items as possible. They find treasure pleasing to look at, and they bask in the radiance of the magical items. For a dragon, there is never enough treasure. Those with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol the immediate areas or to get food. Dragons like to make beds of their treasure, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. By the time they mature to the great wyrm stage, hundreds of gems and coins are imbedded in their hides.}}{{desc8=**Red Dragons:** Red dragons are the most covetous and greedy of all dragons, forever seeking to increase their treasure hoards. They are obsessed with their wealth and memorize an inventory accurate to the last copper. They are exceptionally vain and self confident, considering themselves superior not only to other dragons, but to all other life in general.\nRed dragons can be found on great hills or on soaring mountains. From a high perch they haughtily survey their territory, which they consider to be everything that can be seen from their position. They prefer to lair in large caves that extend deep into the earth.\nA red dragon enjoys its own company, not associating with other creatures, or even other red dragons, unless the dragon\'s aims can be furthered.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Because red dragons are so confident, they never pause to appraise an adversary. When they notice a target they make a snap decision whether to attack, using one of many "perfect" strategies worked out ahead of time in the solitude of their lairs. If the creature appears small and insignificant, such as an unarmored man, the dragon will land to attack with its claws and bite, not wanting to obliterate the creature with its breath weapon, as any treasure might be consumed by the flames. However, if a red dragon encounters a group of armored men, it will use its breath weapon, special abilities, and spells (if it is old enough to have them) before landing.}}'},

They are usually pillar-like in shape, 9 feet tall, about 3 feet in diameter at the base, and about 1 foot in diameter at the top. The roper has a single yellow eye, and a maw ringed with sharp teeth.\nHalfway up its body are small bumps which are the sources of the strands it fires at opponents (see below). Ropers have the same body temperature as their surroundings.\nRopers are not social and rarely cooperate with one another, though a group of them may be found in a good hunting spot. A group of ropers has been named a "cluster" by scholars with nothing better to do.\nRopers reproduce asexually by shedding some of their material in the form of a seed. Drawing nutrients from the cavern floor (and perhaps siphoning magical energies from deep within the earth), the infant roper grows to maturity in 2d4 weeks. Until that time has passed, the roper is indistinguishable from a boulder.\nRopers move using large, cilia-like appendages on their undersides, which also allow them to cling to walls and ceilings. They seldom leave the caverns, but may migrate to a new feeding ground when prey population drops too low in its current home. Migration usually occurs through underground tunnels, but when this is not possible, ropers travel late at night, sometimes giving rise to stories of walking stones.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** A roper can stand upright to resemble a stalagmite, lie on the ground to imitate a boulder, or even flatten itself to look like a lump on a cavern floor. They can change color a little, enough to blend into rocky backgrounds. Opponents suffer a -2 penalty to surprise rolls when faced by a roper.\nRopers attack by shooting strong, sticky strands at opponents. They can shoot a total of six strands, one per round, as far as 50 feet; each strand can extend (1d4+1) x 10 feet and pull up to 750 pounds. Each time a strand hits (requiring a normal attack roll), the victim must make a successful saving throw vs. poison or lose half its Strength (round fractions down). Strength loss occurs 1d3 round after a hit, is cumulative for multiple hits, and lasts for 2d4 turns.\nIf a roper\'s prey cannot break free, it is pulled 10 feet closer per round; when it reaches the roper, the creature bites the victim for 5d4 points of damage (automatic hit against a victim held by a strand). A strand can be pulled off or broken by a character who makes a successful open doors roll. A strand can also be cut; it is AC 0, and it must take at least 6 points damage from a single hit of an edged weapon to be severed.}}'},

They are highly organized and greatly enjoy raiding shore communities for food and sport. Typical sahuagins are blackish green on their backs, shading to green on their bellies, with black fins. Their great, staring eyes are deep, shining black. They have scaly skin, with webbed fingers and toes, and their mouths are filled with sharp fangs. About 1 in 216 sahuagin is a mutation with four usable arms. These specimens are usually black shading to gray. Females are indistinguishable from males, except that they are slightly smaller. Hatchlings are a light green color, but they darken and attain full growth approximately one to two months after hatching.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** See attacks above - equip weapons as needed. Spears are used only as thrusting weapons. Nets are set with dozens of hooks that make escape virtually impossible for unarmored victims or creatures not able to grasp and tear with a Strength of 16 or greater. Nets are replaced by three javelins when the band forays onto land. The crossbows fire a maximum of 30 feet underwater and normal ranges on the surface. Tridents have three uses -- to spear small prey, to pin prey trapped in nets, and to hold threatening opponents at bay.\nWhen raiding villages, sahuagin attack en masse, with leaders in the second rank. As long as there is no truly spirited resistance, they continue in their plunder and violence. Underwater, in their natural element, the sahuagin are far more confident. Using the three-dimensional aspect of underwater fighting, they sometimes dive down on a group of underwater explorers, coming in from behind, and swooping down and past them, dropping nets on their intended victims.\nWhen sahuagin attack ships, they swarm up from all sides and try to overwhelm with numbers. They often grab their opponents and hurl them into the sea, where at least a fourth of the raiding party lurks, waiting for such an action or as reinforcements. Some leaders carry a conch shell, which when sounded gives the signal for the group of sahuagin in reserve to enter the fray. \nSahuagin have an almost paralyzing fear of spellcasters. They direct their strongest attacks toward anyone who uses spells or spell-like powers, such as the functions of some magical items.}}'},

An adult or older silver dragon has scales so fine that the individual scales are scarcely visible. From a distance, these dragons look as if they have been sculpted from pure metal.\nSilver dragons prefer aerial lairs on secluded mountain peaks, or amid the clouds themselves. When they lair in clouds there always will be an enchanted area with a sold floor for laying eggs and storing treasure.\nSilver dragons seem to prefer human form to their own, and often have mortal companions. Frequently they share deep friendships with mortals. Inevitably, however, the dragon reveals its true form and takes its leave to live a dragon\'s life for a time.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Silver dragons are not violent and avoid combat except when faced with highly evil or aggressive foes. If necessary, they use feather fall to stop any missiles fired at them. They use wall of fog or control weather to blind or confuse opponents before making melee attacks.

Their gaunt facial features and deep, sunken black eyes make them seem perpetually grim.\nThe typical stone giant is 18\' tall and weighs 9,000 pounds because of its dense flesh. Females are a little shorter and lighter.\nStone giants, like several other giant races, carry some of their belongings with them. They leave their more valuable items in their lairs, however. A typical stone giant\'s bag will contain 2-24 (2d12) throwing rocks, a portion of the giant\'s wealth, and 1-8 additional common items.\nStone giants prefer to dwell in deep caves high on rocky, storm-swept mountains. They normally live in the company of their relatives, though such a clans usually include no more than 10 giants. Clans of giants do locate their lairs near each other, however, for a sense of community and protection. A mountain range commonly has 2-8 clans lairing there.\nStone giants are crude artists, painting scenes of their lives on the walls of their lairs and on tanned hide scrolls. Some giants are fond of music and play stone flutes and drums. Others make simple jewelry, fashioning painted stone beads into necklaces.\nIf eight or more giants are encountered in a clan\'s lair, one quarter will be female, one quarter male, and the remainder offspring. To determine a giant\'s maturity, roll 1d4. A roll of 4 indicates an infant with no combat ability and hit points of an ogre; rolls of 1-3 indicate older progeny with hit dice, damage, and attack rolls equal to those of a hill giant.\nStone giants are playful, especially at night. They are fond of rock throwing contests and other games that test their might. Tribes of giants will often gather to toss rocks at each other, the losing side being the giants who are hit more often.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** When possible, stone giants fight from a distance. A favorite tactic of stone giants is to stand nearly motionless against rocks, blending in with the background, then moving forward to throw rocks, surprising their foes. Many giants set up piles of rocks near their lair which can be\ntriggered like an avalanche when intruders get too close. \nWhen stone giants are forced into melee combat, they use large clubs chiseled out of stone}}'},

They are sea dwellers, inhabiting warmer waters principally but equally able to live at shallow or great depths.\nThe lower half of a triton ends in two finned legs, while its torso, head, and arms are handsomely human. Tritons have a silvery skin that fades into silver-blue scales on the lower half of their bodies. Their hair is deep blue or blue-green.\nTritons live either in great undersea castles (80% chance) or in finely sculpted caverns (20%). While tritons lean toward good alignment, they are very suspicious of outsiders and have no love for land dwellers in general.\nTritons rarely kill, unless provoked, but they are quick to apprehend those who intrude upon their seas. Trespassers found guilty of intentionally entering triton waters or treasure seeking are left "to the fate of the seas." This means being stripped of all belongings and set adrift at least 10 miles from any shoreline. Characters ruled innocent by the triton court awaken the next day on some distant shore. Tritons never aid land dwellers unless their own interests are involved in the matter.\nFor every 10 tritons encountered there is an exceptional triton of 4-6 Hit Dice. For every 20 encountered there is an exceptional triton with 7-8 Hit Dice. Groups of 50 or more are always accompanied by a triton leader (AC 2, 9 Hit Dice). There is a 10% chance for every 10 tritons encountered that they are accompanied by a triton mage of 1d6 levels.\nAt a triton lair, the following additional tritons are always found:\n60 males (with related exceptional tritons)\nOne mage of 7th- to 10th-level ability\nOne priest of 8th- to 11th-level ability\nFour priests of 2nd- to 5th-level ability\nFemale tritons equal to 100% of males (2 HD, AC 6)\nYoung equal to 100% of males (noncombatants)\nThere is also a 75% chance that the lair contains 2d6 sea lions as pets/guards.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Triton are reclusive and nonviolent. They normally attack to capture. If a triton is killed in a battle, however, the fight immediately becomes one of retribution. Should the fighting go poorly, the tritons withdraw to their lair to either gather reinforcements or make a last stand.\nOutside their lair, tritons are 90% likely to be mounted, either on hippocampi (65%) or giant sea horses (35%). These mounts fight in defense of their riders.}}'},

Their dull, sunken black eyes possess 90-foot infravision. Females are easily distinguished from males; they are both larger and more powerful than their male counterparts.\nTrolls walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. The trolls\' gait is uneven and, when running, the arms dangle free and drag along the ground. For all this seeming awkwardness, trolls are very agile.

Severed limbs continue to fight after separation from the body (hands squeeze, heads bite if stepped on, etc.). Attacks by severed limbs are at normal chances to hit.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Can attack at multiple opponents with 2 claws \\amp bite.

Often trolls rend each other limb from limb, but these battles are never fatal. Still, it is the custom of trolls to toss the loser\'s head a great distance from the fight scene, and frequently losers must sit and stew for a week until their new head grows in.\nThe pack chieftain\'s duties are few. She leads the trolls on nightly forages, loping along, sniffing the air for prey. If a scent is found, the trolls charge, racing to get there first, and letting out a great cry once prey is spotted.

At least one thousand cubic feet of liquid is required to create a shell for the water elemental to inhabit. Usually a large pool serves this purpose, but several large kegs of wine or ale will do just as well.\nThe water elemental appears on the Prime Material Plane as a high-crested wave. The elemental\'s arms appear as smaller waves, one thrust out on each side of its main body. The arms ebb and flow, growing longer or shorter as the elemental moves. Two orbs of deep green peer out of the front of the wave and serve the elemental as eyes}}{{desc1=In combat, the water elemental is a dangerous adversary. It prefers to fight in a large body of water where it can constantly disappear beneath the waves and suddenly swell up behind its opponent.\nWhen the elemental strikes, it lashes out with a huge wave-like arm, doing 5-30 points of damage. Water elementals are also a serious threat to ships that cross their paths. A water elemental can easily overturn small craft (one ton of ship per hit die of the elemental) and stop or slow almost any vessel (one ton of ship per hit point of the elemental). Ships not completely stopped by an elemental will be slowed by a percentage equal to the ratio of ship\'s tons over the hit points of the attacking elemental.\nThough the water elemental is most effective in large areas of open water, it can be called upon to serve in a battle on dry land, close to the body of water from which it arose. However, the movement of the water elemental on land is the most restricted of any elemental type: a water elemental cannot move more than 60 yards away from the water it was conjured from, and 1 point of damage is subtracted from each die of damage they inflict out of the water (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die)}}'},

They are impulsive, vicious, and animalistic, tending to consider only the needs and emotions of the moment and having no foresight or regret. Despite their low intelligence, they are as greedy and evil as the other evil dragons.\nThe scales of a hatchling white dragon are a mirror-like glistening ground. As the dragons ages, the sheen disappears, and by the time it reaches the very old stage, scales of pale blue and light gray are mixed in with the white.\nWhite dragons live in chilly or cold regions, preferring lands where the temperature rarely rises above freezing and ice and snow always cover the ground. When temperatures become too warm, the dragons become lethargic. White dragons bask in the frigid winds that whip over the landscape, and they wallow and play in deep snow banks.\nWhite dragons are lackadaisical parents. Although the young remain with the parents from hatchling to juvenile or young adult stage they are not protected. Once a dragon passes from it hatchling stage, it must fend for itself, learning how to hunt and defend itself, learning how to hunt and defend itself by watching the parents.\nWhite dragons\' lairs are usually icy caves and deep subterranean chambers; they select caves that open away from the warming rays of the sun. White dragons store all of their treasure within their lair, and prefer keeping it in caverns coated in ice, which reflect the gems, especially diamonds, because they are pretty to look at.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Regardless of a target\'s size, a white dragon\'s favorite method of attack is to use its breath weapon and special abilities before closing to melee. This tactic sometimes works to the dragon\'s detriment, as it can exhaust its breath weapon on smaller prey and then be faces with a larger creature it must attack physically. If a white dragon is pursuing creatures in the water, such as polar bears or seal, it will melee them in their element, fighting with its claws and bite.}}'},

Between the arms are large, stone-lidded eyes that see in all directions. At its base are three thick, short legs, each directly beneath an eye. The whole body is designed for burrowing, mouth first.\nIt is only on the Prime Material plane if forcibly summoned or if it was the victim of an interplanar accident. On their native plane, xorn are as peaceful as Prime Material plane herbivores. While xorn are intelligent, their society is limited to small clans of mineral gatherers. These clans wander from place to place, leaving behind open pockets where they have eaten out a vein of mineral. On the Prime Material plane they always seek wide regions of stone underground. What humans would consider treasures, xorn consider food. They keep their store of food in a nearby air pockets.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Xorn do not attack flesh creatures except to defend themselves or their property, since they can not digest flesh.

The normally peaceful xorn can become quite aggressive when after food, especially on the Prime Material plane, where such sustenance is harder to find than it is on its native plane. Xorn expect to be given a reasonable portion in exchange for peaceful passage, or else they attack (90% chance) to get food.\nIn combat, xorn have two different methods of fighting. Against a single opponent, they bend the two legs nearest the opponent deeply, angling their bodies toward the enemy. In this way all four attacks can be brought to bear. Against several opponents, they attack with arms in all directions, each striking at a different target. One of the targets suffers a second attack, as the xorn angles its body down to bite.}}'},

These bards, found mainly in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, filled many important roles in their society. They were storehouses of tribal history, reporters of news, messengers, and even ambassadors to other tribes. However, in the AD\\ampD game, the bard is a more generalized character. Historical and legendary examples of the type include Alan-a-Dale, Will Scarlet, Amergin, and even Homer.

Note that when dancing the staff cannot be physically hit, although certain magical attacks such as a fireball, lightning bolt, or transmute metal to wood spell could affect it.\nFinally, remember that the dancing staff fights alone exactly the same; if a 7th-level thief is the wielder, the staff will so fight when dancing. Relieved of his weapon for four melee rounds, the possessor may act in virtually any manner desired—resting, discharging missiles, drawing another weapon and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, etc.—as long as he remains within [[30]] feet of the staff.

Certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or his gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Note, however, that light never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source).\nThe effect remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, or until the recipient attacks any creature. Thus, the invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if he attacks, he immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables him to attack first. Note that the priest spells bless, chant, and prayer are not attacks for this purpose.}}'},

It has the head of a ram (or a buck goat) as its device. Anyone who attempts a detect magic on the ring discovers an *evocation* upon it.\nThe wearer can cause the ring to give forth a ram-like force, manifested by a vaguely discernible shape which resembles the head of a ram or goat. This force strikes one target for 1d6 points of damage if [one charge](!\\amp#13;\\amp#47;r 1d6 damage for 1 charge expended) is expended, 2d6 points if [two charges](!magic --mi-charges @{selected|token_id}|-1|Ring-of-the-Ram\\amp#13;\\amp#47;r 2d6 damage for 2 charges expended) are used, or 3d6 points if [three charges](!magic --mi-charges @{selected|token_id}|-2|Ring-of-the-Ram\\amp#13;\\amp#47;r 3d6 damage for 3 charges expended) (the maximum) are used. The ring is quite useful for knocking opponents off walls or ladders, or over ledges, among other things. The force of the blow is considerable, and a victim who fails to save versus spell is knocked down. The range of this power is 30 feet. The target of the blow applies adjustments to the saving throw from the following list:\n\\amplt;table\\ampgt;\\amplt;tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;Target smaller than man-sized\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;-1\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;/tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;Larger than man-sized\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;+2\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;/tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;Strength under 12\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;-1\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;/tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;Strength of 18-20\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;+3\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;/tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;Strength over 20\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;+6\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;/tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;4 or more legs\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;+4\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;/tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;Over 1,000 lbs. weight\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;+2\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;/tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;2 charges expended\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;-1\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;/tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;3 charges expended\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;td\\ampgt;-2\\amplt;/td\\ampgt;\\amplt;/tr\\ampgt;\\amplt;/table\\ampgt;\nThe DM can make circumstantial adjustments according to need. For instance, a fire giant balanced on a narrow ledge should not gain any benefit from Strength and weight unless he knows that he\'s about to be struck by the force of the ring. This is a case where common sense will serve best.\nIn addition to its attack mode, the ring of the ram also has the power to open doors as if a person of 18/00 Strength were doing so. If [two charges](!magic --mi-charges @{selected|token_id}|-1|Ring-of-the-Ram\\amp#13;Two charges expended, so @{selected|token_name}\'s equivalent strength is 19) are expended, the effect is as for a character of 19 Strength, and if [three charges](!magic --mi-charges @{selected|token_id}|-2|Ring-of-the-Ram\\amp#13;Three charges expended, so @{selected|token_name}\'s equivalent strength is 20) are expended, the effect is as if a 20 Strength were used. Magically held or locked portals can be opened in this manner. Structural damage from the ramlike force is identical to an actual battering ram, with double or triple damage accruing for applications of two or three charges. Magical items struck by the ramlike force must save versus crushing blow if three charges are used; otherwise, the force will not affect them. Nonmagical items which are the target of the force save versus crushing blow from the impact.\nA ring of this sort will have from 6 to 10 charges when discovered. It can be recharged by a wizard employing enchant an item and Bigby\'s clenched fist in combination.}}'},

Conjured elementals have 8 Hit Dice.\nIt is possible to conjure successive elementals of different types if the spellcaster has memorised two or more of these spells. The type of elemental to be conjured must be decided upon before memorising the spell.

The elemental will not break off a combat to do so, but it will avoid creatures while seeking its conjurer. If the wizard is wounded or grappled, his concentration is broken. There is always a 5% chance that the elemental turns on its conjurer regardless of concentration. This check is made at the end of the second and each succeeding round.

Second, it disrupts the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. Third, it destroys magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell).\nEach effect or potion in the spell\'s area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise, the chance to dispel depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance is 50% (11 or higher on 1d20 to dispel). If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it more likely that the dispel succeeds); if the caster is of lower level, the difference is added to the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it less likely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20 always succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled. A dispel magic spell does not affect a specially enchanted item, such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor, unless it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed and carried by a creature gains the creature\'s saving throw against this effect; otherwise, it is automatically rendered nonoperational. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational would be temporarily closed. Note that an item\'s physical properties are unchanged: A nonoperational magical sword is still a sword.\nArtifacts and relics are not subject to this spell; however, some of their spell-like effects may be, at the DM\'s option.\nNote that this spell can be very effective when used upon charmed and similarly beguiled creatures.

Besides causing damage to creatures, the\nfireball ignites all combustible materials within its burst radius, and the heat of the fireball melts soft metals such as gold, copper, silver, etc. Exposed items require saving throws vs. magical fire to determine if they are affected, but items in the possession of a creature that rolls a successful saving throw are unaffected by the fireball.\nThe wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst.

The message, which must be of 25 words or less, can be in any language known by the spellcaster, and can be delivered over a period of one turn. The mouth cannot speak magical spells or use command words. It does, however, move to the words articulated--if it is placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would actually move and appear to speak. Of course, the magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, door, or any other object, excluding intelligent members of the animal or vegetable kingdoms.\nThe spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled, according to the command of the spellcaster. Some examples are to speak "to the first creature that touches you," or "to the first creature that passes within 30 feet." Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: "Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits crosslegged within 1 foot." Such visual triggers can react to a character using the disguise ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard, so a 6th-level wizard can command the magic mouth to speak at a maximum encounter range of 30 yards ("Speak when a winged creature comes within 30 yards."). The spell lasts until the speak command can be fulfilled; thus, the spell duration is variable. A magic mouth cannot distinguish invisible creatures, alignments, level, Hit Dice, or class, except by external garb. If desired, the effect can be keyed to a specific noise or spoken word.}}'},

The object adheres to the end of the staff, and the wielder need then only swing the staff in an overhand arc to release the missile toward a desired target.\nThe missile leaves the staff on the downstroke of the overhand swing and travels in a low, rising trajectory, with the missile going one foot upward for every 10 feet traveled. Of course, the arc may be higher, or the missile aimed so as to travel nearly vertically. (In the latter case, reverse the arcing ratio so that one foot of distance laterally is covered for every 10 feet of vertical rise.) The maximum range of such a missile is 180 feet, with limits of 60 feet and 120 feet on short and medium range, respectively.\nThis staff also carries charges, and a druid wielding the item can expend one charge and thereby use the staff to hurl a missile of large size, as if the wielder were a stone giant (range out to 300 feet, 3d10 points of damage per hit).

It has the properties of a +2 magical weapon without any expenditure of its magical charges. Its other magical properties are as follows:\n**Thunder:** Take in hand and attack with *Thunder*. The staff strikes as a +3 weapon, and unless the opponent struck saves successfully vs. rods, staves, and wands, he will be stunned from the noise of the staff\'s impact—unable to take any further action in the round struck, and automatically having last initiative in the following round. This power requires the expenditure of one charge.\n**Lightning:** Take in hand and attack with *Lightning*. A short spark of electricity leaps forth when the opponent is struck, causing normal staff damage, plus 2d6 additional points of damage from shock. Note that the staff might not score a hit, but the electrical discharge discounts any form of metal armor (making the target effectively AC 10 for this purpose), so only such damage might apply. This power requires the expenditure of one charge.\n[**Thunderclap:**](!magic --display-ability @{selected|token_id}|Powers-DB|Thunderclap --mi-charges @{selected|token_id}|-2|Staff-of-Thunder+Lightning) The staff sends forth a cone of deafening noise, 5 feet wide at the apex, 40 feet long, and 20 feet wide at a point farthest from the source. All creatures within this cone, wholly or partially, must roll a successful saving throw vs. rods, staves, and wands or be stunned for 1d2 rounds (unable to attack during this time) and unable to hear for 1d2 additional rounds. Those who save are unable to hear for 1d4 rounds, but suffer no loss of attacks. This function requires the expenditure of two charges.\n[**Lightning Stroke:**](!magic --display-ability @{selected|token_id}|Powers-DB|Lightning-Stroke} --mi-charges @{selected|token_id}|-2|Staff-of-Thunder+Lightning) A bolt similar to that from a wand of lightning is generated, but it is of 8d6 strength, causing 16-48 points of damage (rolls of 1 are counted as 2) to those who fail a saving throw. The stroke can be single or forked. This function of the rod uses two charges.\n[**Thunder \\amp Lightning:**](!magic --display-ability @{selected|token_id}|Powers-DB|Thunder+Lightning} --mi-charges @{selected|token_id}|-4|Staff-of-Thunder+Lightning) This power combines the thunderclap, described above, with a forked lightning bolt as in the lightning stroke. Damage from the lightning is a total of 8d6 with rolls of 1 or 2 counted as rolls of 3, for a range of 24-48 points. A saving throw applies, with deafness and half damage suffered by those who are successful. This power requires the expenditure of four charges.\nThe casting time required for any function is equal to the number of charges expended; thus, the thunder \\amp lightning function costs four charges and has an initiative modifier of +4.}}'},

It can be used to *absorb* wizard spell energy directed at its wielder, but if the staff absorbs energy beyond its charge limit, it will explode as if a "retributive strike" (see below) had been made. The spell levels of energy absorbed count only as recharging the staff, but they cannot be redirected immediately, so if absorption is desired, that is the only action possible by the staff wielder that round. Note also that the wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at him, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. Absorbing spells is risky, but absorption is the only way this staff can be recharged.\nRetributive strike is a breaking of the staff. It must be purposeful and declared by the wizard wielding it. When this is done all levels of spell energy in the staff are released in a globe of 30-foot radius. All creatures within 10 feet of the broken staff suffer hit points of damage equal to eight times the number of spell levels of energy in the rod (1 to 25), those between 10 feet to 20 feet take 6 x levels, and those 20 feet to 30 feet distant take 4 x levels. Successful saving throws versus magic indicate only one-half damage is sustained.\nThe wizard breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence, but if he does not, the explosive release of spell energy totally destroys him.\nThis staff and the staff of power are the only magical items capable of a retributive strike.}}{{Use=Take the staff in-hand using the *Change Weapon* dialogue, then use the *Attack* action to use it as a weapon or use its powers. Use any of the spell buttons in order to cast those spells, which automatically expends the relevant number of charges.\nTo absorb spell levels, use the *Absorb Wizard Spell* button and ask the DM to select how many levels to absorb (a choice will appear on the DM\'s screen) - this does not reflect what the *character* knows, as they do not know the number of levels absorbed. The device will respond with success or if a *retributive strike* initiated!}}'},

If for any reason the gem is not kept beyond the three-month period, the additional Intelligence remains, but the additional Wisdom is lost. A *gem of insight* functions once every 50 years.

Furthermore, they gain its physical mode of locomotion and breathing as well. No system shock roll is required. The amulet does not give the new form\'s other abilities (attack, magic, special movement, etc.), nor does it run the risk of the user changing personality and mentality.\nWhen the polymorph occurs, the user\'s equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a ring of protection, to continue operating effectively). The user retains all mental abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the material components are available. A user not used to a new form might be penalised at the DM\'s option (for example, -2 penalty to attack rolls) until they practice sufficiently to master it.\nThus, a user changed into an owl could fly, but his vision would be human; a change to a black pudding would enable movement under doors or along halls and ceilings, but not the pudding\'s offensive (acid) or defensive capabilities. Naturally, the strength of the new form is sufficient to enable normal movement. The user retains their own hit points, attack rolls, and saving throws.

Each is a Tome containing 2+1d4 tested and experimental rites and rituals, some of which might work but many of which are disastrous to attempt - there are also always an additional 4+1d8 blank pages. The Tome can only hold and retain rituals to cast MU spells with Casting Times of 2 or more Rounds - though often the rituals will take Turns to perform. If spells of shorter casting times are written into the Tome, they are absorbed into the page and disappear. Each Tome is fireproof (but only gains a save at +4 vs. magical fire) and proof against Dispel Magic, Disintegration and similar magical destruction (other than magical fire). They all have some type of lock on them, most often a magical lock such as a Glyph of Warding but sometimes just a physical lock.\nWizards of any level can use the Tome, and even attempt to perform any of the Rituals therein. Tried and tested Rituals (i.e. to cast defined spells as from the PHB, the Complete Wizard\'s Handbook or the Tome of Magic) can be cast from the Tome with a success rate never greater than 90% minus 5% for each level between the casting MU and the level required to cast the spell. Success means the ritual has the described effect: failure has a chance of summoning an avatar of Math Mathonwy (see AD\\ampD Legends \\amp Lore - Celtic Mythos for details of the avatar), 20% plus 5% per level of the Ritual being performed. The avatar will endeavour to recover the Tome and return immediately to the plane of the Celtic Gods.\nExperimental rituals (researched and devised by the Wizard as per DMG, or by the DM) will have chances of success or failure as determined by the DM and appropriate to the ritual concerned. Failure may incur additional penalties but will always have a chance of an avatar of Math Mathonwy appearing to be determined based on an equivalent level of the ritual as determined by the DM.\nWizards cannot transfer rituals from the Tome into their spell books - for some reason they never seem to transcribe correctly. However, Wizards of any level do not have to do any other check to use the rituals other than described above.}}{{materials=Book}}'},

Hurl the sphere at an opponent up to 30 yards away as a ranged weapon, with 10 yards away at +3 to hit, 11-20 yards away at +2 to hit, and 21-30 yards away at +1 to hit.\nA miss, or a successful save vs. spell means it has no effect. Otherwise, the color determines the damage inflicted and its special power. The caster can create a single orb of any color listed for his level or lower.\n***Light:*** the victim is surrounded by light to a radius of 20 feet, as if affected by a light spell. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time the victim makes his attack rolls and saving throws at a -4 penalty, and his AC is penalized by 4.\n***Heat:*** intense enough to melt 1 cubic yard of ice. The victim suffers a loss of 1 point of Strength and 1 point of Dexterity (or for victims without these attributes, -1 to hit and a penalty of 1 to AC) for 1 round.\n***Fire:*** ignites all combustible materials within 3 feet of the victim.\n***Blindness:*** causes the victim to become blind as per the spell. The effect lasts for 1 round/level of the caster.\n***Stinking cloud:*** the victim is in a 5-foot-radius noxious cloud. The victim must save vs. poison or will be reeling and unable to attack until he leaves the area of the vapors.\n***Magnetism:*** has an effect only if the victim is wearing armor made from iron, which becomes magically magnetized for 3-12 (3d4) rounds. Iron objects within 3 ft will stick tight to the magnetized armor; only dispel magic or a similar spell can release the stuck items, released at the end of the spell\'s duration.\n***Paralysis:*** victim becomes paralyzed for 6-20 (2d8 + 4) rounds; save vs. paralyzation halves the number of rounds.\n***Petrification:*** turns the victim to stone. Save vs. petrification instead *slows* the victim (as per the spell) for 2-8 (2d4) rounds. \n***Death:*** the victim dies.

It is a power available to intelligent magic items that have *ego* scores such as intelligent swords.\n**Domination:** can project signals from its own mind into the mind of one other person or creature (possibly only its possessor). if dominant on an Ego Battle score, the subject is forced to do nearly anything the wielder of the power wishes. The dominated subject knows what is happening, but they cannot resist the objects will. Commands are given mentally and automatically. The victims abilities are neither diminished nor enhanced by this power. The subject can be forced to use any power or ability he normally can-assuming the psionicist knows about it.\nDomination does not reveal facts or secrets about a victim. As soon as domination is attempted, an ego check is made between the *personality scores* of the item and the character. If the victim wins the domination is not successful: but if the difference is less than 10 points the victim suffers bad headaches if they don\'t comply with the wishes. If dominated, but the victim is later forced to do something completely abhorrent (against their alignment), they can make another ego check at +10 to regain their free will.\n**Mindlink:** Mindlink allows the item to communicate wordlessly with any intelligent creature he can contact (usually the possessor, intelligence 5 or greater on a human scale). This is two-way communication. It is not the same as mind-reading because the psionicist only receives thoughts which the other party wants to send. Language is not a barrier. Distance affects the telepath\'s ability to make contact, but it has no other effect.\n**Probe:** A probe is similar to ESP, but a probe allows the item to dig much deeper into a subjects subconscious. If the subject fails an *ego battle* personality check, then all his memories and knowledge are accessible to the prober-from memories deep below the surface to those still fresh in the subject\'s mind. The information gained is not necessarily true, but it is true as far as the subject knows. The item wielding the power can learn the answer to one question per round. DMs have some discretion in determining this rate. If the questions (or answers) become too complicated, each may take longer than one round to resolve. Telepaths can probe a subject who is conscious, as well as one who resists. A probe can even be carried out in the midst of melee, provided the telepath can get close enough. If a probed wizard or cleric tries casting a spell, the telepath knows both that a spell is being cast and what the general effects of that spell are.}}'},

							+'<h2>V2.3.0 Release Notes</h2>'
							+'<h3>New creatures, with powers, weapons, classes and effects</h3>'
							+'<p>A number of new <i>Drag & Drop</i> creatures have been added, including many Giants, Metalic & Chromatic Dragons, Winter Wolves, Centaurs, Ropers, Hell Hounds and Titans, along with all their powers, weapons and spell-casting abilities.</p>'
							+'<h3>New RaceData attributes</h3>'
							+'<p>Mainly to support <i>Drag & Drop</i> dragons, new attributes have been added to RaceData specifications: Age, Magic resistance, and Spell Speed Override (e.g. dragons always cast spells at 1 segment). The Age attribute takes the form <code>text:#</code>, with the text version of the age being displayed in the <i>Age</i> field of the character sheet (this can of course just be the numeric age). The # is used in maths to affect other attributes and use of powers & spells. See the <i>Class & Race Database Help</i> handout for details.</p> '
							+'<h3><i>Drag & Drop</i> Creature \'Query\' Attribute</h3>'
							+'<p>A new drag & drop creature RaceData \'query\' attribute has been created that adds an extra level of query to <i>Drag & Drop</i> creature selection and returns variables based on the selection. This is used, for instance, when <i>Dragging & Dropping</i> a Dragon to ask the GM for its age, which affects many of the attributes & powers of the Dragon. See the <i>Class & Race Database Help</i> handout for more information.</p>'
							+'<h3>Maths Evaluator for <i>Drag & Drop</i> Creature Attributes</h3>'
							+'<p> A new maths evaluation function has been added to support new race \'query\' variables. It is not possible to use the Roll20 chat maths for various reasons when specifying creature attributes that are dependent on the values returned by the new \'query\' attribute described above, so a new simple maths evaluator has been added to the APIs to support the likes of Dragon age variation. See the <i>Class & Race Database Help</i> handout for more information.</p>'
							+'<h3>Random Spells for Spell-casting <i>Drag & Drop</i> creatures</h3>'
							+'<p>It has been possible to specify spellbooks for <i>Drag & Drop</i> creatures that can cast spells for some time. However, it is now possible to add random spells (randomly selected and added to the spell book at creation) to the spell book. Just put the word "random" in as a spell name when specifying a spell book in the <i>Drag & Drop</i> creature specification e.g. <code>[cl:MU,lv:2,w:random|random|random]</code> would add three random spells to the creature\'s 2nd level spell book. As always, see the <i>Class & Race Database Help</i> handout for more information</p>'
							+'<h3><i>Drag & Drop</i> Auto-Memorisation of Spells as well as Powers</h3>'
							+'<p><i>Drag & Drop</i> creature Powers have always automatically been memorised. It is now the case that any spell-casting <i>Drag & Drop</i> creatures will memorise random sets of spells from their spell-books at each level appropriate to their casting capabilities.  Priests always have all spells for their allowed spheres available for memorising and random spells will be selected from these as appropriate. But wizard classes may or may not have spell-books specified. If a <i>Drag & Drop</i> creature has a wizard casting level but no spells specified for their spell-books (using the <code>[cl:MU,lv:#,w:...|...|...]</code> syntax), the APIs will automatically randomly memorise valid spells appropriate to each valid spell casting level from all valid spells, and add these memorised spells to the creature\'s spell books. Of course, in the case of both Priest and Wizard classes, the GM can adjust the spells in the spell-books using the appropriate button on the GM\'s [Token Setup] dialog, and memorise different spells from the spell-book using the <i>Spells Menu / Memorise Spells</i> dialog.</p>'
							+'<h3>\'specmu\' ClassData Attribute</h3>'
							+'<p>The new \'specmu\' ClassData attribute flags this class is to be <code>specmu:1</code> or not be <code>specmu:0</code> a specialist Wizard class. Defaults to 1 for new classes of Wizard, meaning they can memorise an additional spell per spell level in their specialist school.</p>'
							+'<h3>Multiple Effect Instances</h3>'
							+'<p>To date, it has been possible to only simultaneously run multiple copies of the same Effect by adding a <i>Differentiator</i> to the called Effect name (see <i>RoundMaster API Help</i> handout for details). Invoking any Effect more than once using <code>!rounds --target</code> or <code>!rounds --addstatus</code> or any related command would overwrite, extend or otherwise change the duration and direction of the Effect, depending on the \'operator\' preceding the Effect <i>duration</i> (+,-,<,>,=). A new operator is now allowed: \'#\'. Specifying a duration such as #5 will spawn a new Status of the same name with duration of 5 rounds, apply any Effect-start specification again, invoke Effect-turn multiply each round, and invoke Effect-end as each instance of the Effect ends. An example of this use is the Roper Strand - multiple Roper Strand hits can affect the victim\'s Strength score at the same time.</p>'
							+'<h3>Item-Specific Spell Lists</h3>'
							+'<p>To date, specific spell book entries for spell-storing magic items were not allocated specifically to the item they were stored in: if two items had the same spell stored, and one of those spells had not yet been cast, either item could cast the remaining available spell which could cause issues and invalid game play. Spells are now tied to the item they are stored on even if the same spell is stored on two or more items. This approach has always been the case for items with powers - spells now use the same storing mechanism. However, backwards compatibility has been retained for use of legacy items and items already "owned" by characters.</p>'
							+'<h3>New !magic --change-attr Maths Operators</h3>'
							+'<p>The MagicMaster API command --change-attr can be used in Effects and the chat window to adjust the value of a character\'s attribute by a +/- amount. This takes account of strength 18 percentages (which will actually work on any attribute, though this is not strictly valid for 2e). Now, in addition you can use a \'*\' for multiply and \'/\' for divide to adjust the attribute by a specified factor. Several examples of this use can be seen in the Effects-DB.</p>'
							+'<h3>Multiple Bug Fixes</h3>'
							+'<p>The following bugs have been fixed</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+'<li>Fixed bug that prevented \'-turn\' effects working under some circumstances</li>'
							+'<li>Fixed two-weapon attack speeds where one weapon has less than one attack per round.</li>'
							+'<li>Fixed calculation of non-proficient weapon penalties set for classes & races.</li>'
							+'<li>Fixed checking valid spells & valid powers which would show invalid spells/powers as valid under some circumstances.</li>'
							+'<li>Fixed character level of creature that has both HD & caster level.</li>'
							+'<li>Fixed save mods due to some magic items not being correctly applied.</li>'
							+'<li>Several small database data fixes. </li>'

							+'<h2>1. General RPGMaster Library information</h2>'
							+'<p>The RPGMaster Library API provides the data and rule-set processing for a specific RPG version and Roll20 Character Sheet for the RPGMaster series of APIs. This particular Library supports the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons v2e RPG, and the Advanced D&D 2e Character Sheet by Peter B.</p>'
							+'<p>The functions and data in the Library cannot be accessed directly by the GM or Players (with the exception of the RPGMaster Roll Templates). It does not support any API commands directly, but supports the functioning of the API commands provided by other RPGMaster APIs: <b>InitiativeMaster, AttackMaster, MagicMaster</b> and <b>CommandMaster</b>, to the extent that these APIs will not function without the Library being loaded. <b>Note:</b> RoundMaster does not have any RPG-version specific aspects, is independent of the Library, and does not require a RPGMaster Library to be loaded to function.</p>'
							+'<p>The Library does Roll Template processing for RPGMaster-defined Roll Templates. These can be used by GMs to create their own Chat menus and displays.  See the descriptions in Section 2 for how to access and use these templates.</p>'
							+'<p>The Library also provides a number of objects and functions that can be called from other APIs. These include an extensive Character Sheet table management suite described in Section 3 below, for table structures defined by The Aaron in various standard Roll20 Character Sheets, such as the Advanced D&D 2e character sheet by Peter B. There are a number of other useful functions, which are described in Section 3.</p>'

							+'<p>Roll Templates are standard Roll20 functionality, often provided by various Character Sheet versions. The RPGMaster Library provides RPGMaster-specific versions of Roll Templates to support gameplay using the RPGMaster series of APIs. Of course, they can also be used for other purposes by the GM to support their design for gameplay, and by other APIs that might be loaded alongside the RPGMaster Library API. The list of those provided is:</p>'

							+'<p>The templates are built upon four base templates: <i>RPGMattack, RPGMspell, RPGMmessage,</i> and <i>RPGMdefault</i>. However, each individual template can have different colour swatches and background images. It is also possible for the GM to use special template field tags to change the colours and background images of various parts of the templates, as described below.</p>'
							+'<h3>2.1 User-Selectable Template Display Options</h3>'
							+'<p>In the API configuration menu, opened using <b>!attk --config</b> or <b>!magic --config</b>, the GM can choose whether the default display of RPGMaster Roll Templates for everyone is <i>Fancy</i>, meaning the system uses background textures and images to make the chat templates look interesting, or <i>Plain</i>, which means the default display is of coloured templates but without textures or images.</p>'
							+'<p>In addition, each Player can choose their own options: at the top right of every menu or message displayed in the chat using a RPGMaster Template is a cog wheel. Clicking this cog wheel will display an options dialog for the Player with three options - Menus with Images, Plain Menus, and Dark Mode Menus. The Player can select one of the options, and the current and all future menus and messages using RPGMaster Roll Templates will be displayed for that particular Player using this new option. The option persists for that Player between gameplay sessions.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> if use of a template includes any of the colour or image field tags (<i>outer image, title image</i> or <i>body image</i>) these images will always appear regardless of which option the Player chooses. The field tags always override the original template definition.</p>'
							+'<h3>2.2 Colour, Padding and Image Override Field Tags</h3>'
							+'<p>All RPGMaster templates can use the following field tags (with some exceptions as noted). The field tags are used in this way:</p>'
							+'<pre>{{field tag=... whatever you want to be in this field ...}}</pre>'
							+'<p>However, the fields in this table do not display data, but take the content of the field after the "=" as data for a CSS command to change the behavior of the template.</p>'

							+'<p>The data passed with these field tags is one of four types: <i>color, padding spec, shadow spec</i> or <i>image URL</i>. Note, the CSS keyword is not needed in each case, just the data specification that would follow the keyword.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Tip:</b> <i>In fact, you can sneak additional CSS keywords into the data - e.g. the <b>title text</b> colour could be \'{{title text=white; text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px gray}}\' which would sneak a drop-shadow onto the title text of the Template. This will not always work, but is worth trying.</i></p>'

							+'</table>'
							+'<h3>2.3 Dice Rolls and Roll Reuse</h3>'
							+'<p>As with any message sent to the Roll20 chat window, it is possible to use standard functions such as in-line rolls and maths.  These all work in exactly the standard way that they do in any other template or message. In some fields of an RPGMaster template, such as those being used to assess success criteria for a <i>{{Result= ... }}</i>, such rolls and calculations are necessary and important.</p>'
							+'<p>Just as useful is the ability to reuse the value of in-line rolls at other points in the RPGMaster roll templates. In order to reuse a roll result, use the syntax <b>$[[#]]</b>, where # is the 1-based index of which roll in the template is being reused. For example, here is a template used for a power that only deducts a charge of the magic item that cast the power if the dice roll of 1d10 is equal to the value 2, but a roll of 1 is also a success, and anything other than 1 or 2 is a failure:</p>'
							+'<h3>Improve Gem</h3>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;">&{template:RPGMdefault}{{title=@{selected|token_name} attempts to<br>**Improve a Gem**<br>using a *Jewel of Flawlessness*}}Specs=[Improve Gem,Power,1H,Alteration]{{Speed=[[10]]}}{{Range=0}}{{Duration=Permanent}}{{Area of Effect=Jewels in same container with *Jewel of Flawlessness*}}{{save=None}}{{reference=DMG p173}}SpellData=[w:Improve Gem,sp:10,cs:M]{{desc=When a jewel of flawlessness is placed with other gems, it doubles the likelihood of their being more valuable (i.e., the chance for each stone going up in value increases from 10% to 20%). The jewel has from 10-100 facets, and whenever a gem increases in value because of the magic of the jewel of flawlessness (a roll of 2 on d10), one of these facets disappears. When all are gone, the jewel is a spherical stone that has no value.}}{{Need to Roll=2 or less}}<mark style="color:green">{{Improvement Roll=[[1d10]]}}</mark>{{Result=Need to Roll>=Improvement Roll}}{{successcmd=!magic ~~mi-charges @{selected|token_id}¦<mark style="color:blue">-[[$[[1]]-1]]</mark>¦Jewel-of-Flawlessness¦¦charged}}</p>'
							+'<p>The <i>{{Need to Roll=2 or less}}</i> sets the target that represents success. The in-line roll is included in <i>{{Improvement Roll=[[1d10]]}}</i>. The two values are compared in the <i>{{Result=Need to Roll>=Improvement Roll}}</i> which results in Success or Failure being displayed on the Roll Template in the chat window and, if successful, the <i>{{successcmd=...}}</i> command being run. In this case, the command is a call to the <b>!magic --mi-charges</b> function that will deduct charges from the magic item named in the call in the character\'s equipment bag. But a charge is only deducted if the roll of the dice is 2, as per the specification of the magic item in the DMG. To use the value of the in-line roll in both calculating the <i>Result</i> and use in the <i>successcmd</i> command, the roll needs to be referenced in the <i>successcmd</i> using the <b>$[[1]]</b> reference syntax as part of the in-line calculation <b>[[$[[1]]-1]]</b>. As successcmd will only execute on success of the Result, which happens if the in-line dice roll is 1 or 2, "successful dice roll minus 1" is 0 or 1, and negating this is -0 on a roll of 1 and -1 on a roll of 2.</p>'
							+'<p>If there were more rolls, these would be referenced using <b>$[[2]], $[[3]], ...</b> etc.</p>'
							+'<h3>2.4 Template Definitions</h3>'
							+'<h4>RPGMattack</h4>'
							+'<p>As with any template, the text in any of the fields can be anything allowed by Roll20 in a macro or template, except where noted otherwise. If to be used with a RPGMaster API database, the <i>Specs</i> and <i>Data</i> fields must be configured in line with the relevant database documentation and placed <i>between</i> the template fields so as not to be seen by the Players when the Roll Template is displayed. This is a highly graphical template (even in Plain Mode) and the Field Tags are generally not displayed.</p>'

							+'<pre>LibRPGMaster.function( parameters )</pre>'
							+'<p>Alternatively, so as not to need to reference the Library, and/or to facilitate an easily alterable and maintainable reference that can be changed in one place, the Library reference can be made within a function mapping, like this:</p>'

							+'<h3>3.2 Manage Character Sheet Tables</h3>'
							+'<p>Some data on Character Sheets is best represented in tables, made up of multiple rows of multiple fields. Some tables can also have multiple columns of rows, each column containing rows which in turn have multiple fields (in fact, each column is considered a table in itself). Having a structured set of functions to add to, find, read, update, and remove data in these tables is a useful function to have. the <b>ChatSetAttr API</b> from The Aaron provides an amount of such functionality, but the RPGMaster Library provides a full suite of management functions, based on the definition of a standard Table Object, with associated Methods. The mechanics of the Character Sheet table are then hidden from the author of the API, who can concentrate on other functionality.</p>'
							+'<p>The Library consists of the Table Object, and the Methods. The mechanics of the Table Object are hidden from the API (but can be exposed & used if you know what you are doing and understand the structure of Character Sheet tables fully).

See the database help handouts distributed with the RPGMaster APIs for more information on each type of database.</p>'

							+'<p>A function to build or get and return an index to all entries in the RPGMaster databases. This function <b><i>must</i></b> be called before any items in the databases are queried or acted upon with the other database management functions. Having this index (which is globally held in the system) speeds up database access considerably over relying on the Roll20 object management functions, and allows the APIs to seamlessly access items that might be in either internal object databases or held in external character sheet databases, and supports the prioritisation of user-defined database items over Library defined items. Takes one optional parameter:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+	'<li><b><i>forceUpdate:</i></b> (optional) A boolean flag: if true, forces the global database index to be recreated from scratch. If false or not provided, only builds the index if it does not already exist (e.g. when the game session has just started and the APIs initialise)</li>'
							+'</ul><br>'
							+'<pre>dbItemObject = abilityLookup( rootDB, dbItemName, <i>character, silent, default</i> );</pre>'
							+'<p>A function to get an entry from a database. Uses the global DBindex internally to access the correct database entry directly, eliminating the speed of a Roll20 object search. The building of the index using getDBindex() will determine the priority order of the potential sources for database items: see that function description for details. However, if the item does not have an entry in the DBindex (i.e. is not in any currently loaded database), and if a character sheet object is passed as a parameter, this abilityLookup() function will also search the character sheet for a copy of the database item which might have previously been placed there by a getAbility() function call. This allows characters to have items that come from user-defined databases in one campaign that are carried with them to other campaigns which perhaps don\'t have the same user-defined databases loaded.</p>'
							+'<p>Takes the following parameters:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+	'<li><b>rootDB:</b> The root database name for the type of item being recovered. Will access indexes from any database name that starts with the rootDB name. Can be one of <i>MU-Spells-DB, PR-Spells-DB, Powers-DB, MI-DB, Attacks-DB, Class-DB</i></li>'
							+	'<li><b>dbItemName:</b> The name of the item being searched for. The following characters are ignored: \'-\', \'_\', \'space\'.</li>'
							+	'<li><b><i>character:</i></b> (optional) the character sheet object for the character sheet for which the item is relevant, and which might hold any orphaned item that is not available in current databases.</li>'
							+	'<li><b><i>silent:</i></b> (optional) a boolean value which, if true, will surpress any error message if the rootDB is invalid or the item cannot be found. False or not provided will result in error messages being returned.</li>'
							+	'<li><b><i>default:</i></b> (optional) a boolean value which, if false, returns < undefined > for any database item object if the item is not found or other errors occur, or if true or not defined returns a default item with the following structure:<br>'

							+'<h2>Character Sheet and Token setup for use with RPGMaster APIs</h2>'
							+'<h3>1. Using APIs to do setup</h3>'
							+'<p>The simplest way to configure a Character Sheet for use with the RPGMaster APIs is to use the functions of the APIs to set up the Character Sheet. If the <b>CommandMaster API</b> is installed, a number of features and commands are provided to help the DM/Game Creator in this process.</p>'
							+'<p>The most basic of these is to configure a blank Character Sheet.</p>'
							+'<ul><li>Use the [+Add] button on the Roll20 Journal to add a new blank Character Sheet, and Roll20 displays a form to give the sheet a name (or accept with the default provided by Roll20) and optionally an image.</li>'
							+'<li>Select the [Save Changes] button on this form, and then close the blank Character Sheet.</li>'
							+'<li>Drag the newly created Character Sheet onto the map area of the Roll20 UI.</li>'
							+'<li>Switch to the Chat Window, and the <i>Review & Set Race & Classes</i> menu has appeared (scroll down to the bottom if need be).</li>'
							+'<li>If this menu has not appeared, the menu can be opened on the DM\'s Token-Setup button.</li>'
							+'<li>Make sure the token you have just placed on the map area is selected (often it is not).</li>'
							+'<li>Selecting a Creature type from the Creature drop-down list will automatically setup the Character Sheet and Token to work with the APIs as that creature, setting all necessary fields and setting the Token as the default token for the Character Sheet. At this point the token can immediately be used in play as that creature.</li>'
							+'<li>Selecting a Race and/or Class & level for the Character Sheet will not do as much - the basics will be set, but'
								+'<ul><li>the Character Attributes of Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma must be rolled for and added to the sheet manually</li>'
								+'<li>the Token is not linked or set up, as many fields still need to have values set</li>'
								+'<li>use the <i>Token-Setup</i> menu to add Character menu action buttons to the Character Sheet, which provide menu access for Players</li>'
								+'<li>the DM\'s <i>Token-Setup</i> menu can be used to complete setting other aspects of the character before play</li>'
								+'<li>if appropriate, once everything is set up manually make the token the default for the Character Sheet</li></ul>'
							+'<li>Use either the DM\'s <i>Add-Items</i> menu or the Character\'s <i>Attk-Menu / Edit Weapons & Armour</i> menu to add equipment including weapons & armour to Characters and even Creatures that can make use of them.</li>'
							+'<li>Use the Character\'s <i>Attk-Menu / Change Weapons</i> menu to take weapons, shields, and other items in-hand, ready to use in attacks.</li>'
							+'<li>Wizards and Priests can have spells added to their spell books on the DM\'s <i>Token-Setup / Add to Spellbook</i> menu. Then spells can be memorised from the spellbook using the Character\'s <i>Spell-Menu / Memorise Spells</i> menu.</li>'
							+'<li>There are many other features of the APIs that can be used to enhance the Character / NPC being created with Powers, Magic Items and Proficiencies with weapons and Fighting Styles. Explore the other help handouts that come with the APIs for more information.</li></ul>'
							+'<p>Alternatively, the Character Sheet can be set up manually from scratch, or existing Characters with Character Sheets can be adapted for use with the APIs.  This option is explored in the rest of this document. However, adding information (other than Character Attributes) to the Character Sheet manually will never be as functionally rich as using the APIs for setting up the sheet, and in some cases will restrict the operation of the APIs to not work in the optimal way. Always use the API menus where possible.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h3>2. Token configuration</h3>'
							+'<p>The API can work with any Token configuration but requires tokens that are going to participate in API actions to represent a Character Sheet, so that actions relevant to the token and the character it represents can be selected. </p>'
							+'<p>A single Character Sheet can have multiple Tokens representing it, and each of these are able to do individual actions made possible by the data on the Character Sheet jointly represented.  However, if such multi-token Characters / NPCs / creatures are likely to encounter spells that will affect the Character Sheet (such as <i>Haste</i> and <i>Slow</i>) they must be split with each Token representing a separate Character Sheet, or else the one spell will affect all tokens associated with the Character Sheet, whether they were targeted or not!  In fact, <b>it is recommended that tokens and character sheets are 1-to-1 to keep things simple.</b></p>'
							+'<p>The recommended Token Bar assignments for all APIs in the Master Series are:</p>'
							+'<pre>Bar1 (Green Circle):	Armour Class (AC field) - only current value<br>'
							+'Bar2 (Blue Circle):	Base Thac0 (thac0-base field) before adjustments - only current value<br>'
							+'Bar3 (Red Circle):	Hit Points (HP field) - current & max</pre>'
							+'<p>It is recommended to use these assignments, and they are the default bar assignments set by the <b>CommandMaster API</b> if its facilities are used to set up the tokens: the CommandMaster functions can be used to change the defaults to whatever you require.  However the bars are set (using CommandMaster or manually), the APIs will always search for the most appropriate fields to use from the token and character sheet - only if the APIs can\'t find valid values will they revert to using the default fields on the token. It is recommended that all tokens are set the same way, whatever way you eventually choose.</p>'
							+'<h3>3. Use with various game system character sheets</h3>'
							+'<p>The latest version of the RPGMaster series APIs use various game and character sheet-specific versions the <b>RPGMaster Library</b> to implement the relevant rules, parameters and databases specific to a game-version and/or Roll20 character sheet version.  Loading the correct RPGMaster Library will configure all the RPGMaster APIs to work with that game rule set and character sheet. <b>However:</b> at the time of writing, only the AD&D 2E game version, and Advanced D&D 2E Character Sheet by Peter B. are supported.</p>'
							+'<h3>4. Matching the API to a type of Character Sheet</h3>'
							+'<p>As with other game and character sheet specific configuration, selecting the correct RPGMaster Library will configure the RPGMaster APIs for the character sheet in use.  If a character sheet does not have the fields specified in the Library, the RPGMaster APIs will create them - it can, in fact, work with a totally blank character sheet definition and it will create all of the fields it requires from scratch: it just won\'t look very pretty or be very usable as a character sheet! However, you can alter the Library to work with any character sheet as follows (though the game rules and databases will remain those coded in that version of the Library).</p>'
							+'<p>The Library API has an object definition called \'fields\', which contains items of the form </p>'
							+'<pre>Internal_api_name: [sheet_field_name, field_attribute, optional_default_value, optional_set_with_worker_flag]</pre>'
							+'<p>A typical example might be:</p>'
							+'<pre>Fighter_level:[\'level-class1\',\'current\'],<br>'
							+'Or<br>'
							+'MUSpellNo_memable:[\'spell-level-castable\',\'current\',\'\',true],</pre>'
							+'<p>The <i>internal_api_name</i> <b><u>must not be altered!</b></u> Doing so will cause the system not to work.  However, the <i>sheet_field_name</i> and <i>field_attribute</i> can be altered to match any character sheet.</p>'
							+'<p>Table names are slightly different: always have an <i>internal_api_name</i> ending in \'_table\' and their definition specifies the repeating table name and the index of the starting row of the table or -1 for a static field as the 1<sup>st</sup> row.</p>'
							+'<pre>Internal_api_table: [sheet_repeating_table_name,starting_index]</pre>'
							+'<p>An example is:</p>'
							+'<pre>MW_table:[\'repeating_weapons\',0],</pre>'
							+'<p>The <i>internal_api_table</i> <b><u>must not be altered!</b></u> Doing so will cause the system not to work.  However, the <i>sheet_repeating_table_name</i> and <i>starting_index</i> can be altered to match any character sheet.</p>'
							+'<p>Each character sheet must have repeating tables to hold weapons, ammo and magic items, as well as other data (if it does not, or they are not the ones specified in the <i>fields</i> object, the APIs will create them).  By default, melee weapons \'in hand\' are held in sections of the repeating_weapons table, melee weapon damage in the repeating_weapons-damage table, ranged weapons in the repeating_weapons2 table, ammo in the repeating_ammo table, and magic items are held in the repeating_potions table.  The table management system provided by the API expands and writes to repeating attributes automatically, and the DM & Players do not need to worry about altering or updating any of these tables on the Character Sheet. If the Character Sheet does not have tables to display any specific table, the APIs will create the table and attach it to the sheet and will be able to use it, but the Players and DM will not see the content except through the API menus and dialogues.</p>'
							+'<h3>5. Character Attributes, Races, Classes and Levels</h3>'
							+'<p>Character Attributes of <i>Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom</i> and <i>Charisma</i> are generally not directly important to the RPGMaster Series APIs, but the resulting bonuses and penalties are.  All Attributes and resulting modifiers should be entered into the Character Sheet in the appropriate places (that is in the Character Sheet fields identified in the \'fields\' API object as noted in section 2 above).</p>'
							+'<p>The Character\'s race is also important for calculating saves and ability to use certain items.  The race should be set in the appropriate Character Sheet field.  Currently, the races <i>\'dwarf\', \'elf\', \'gnome\', \'halfelf\', \'halfling\', \'half-orc\'</i> and <i>\'human\'</i>, as well as many of their sub-races, are implemented (not case sensitive, and spaces, hyphens and underscores are ignored).  If not specified, <i>human</i> is assumed.  The race impacts saves, some magic items and armour, and bonuses on some attacks, as well as granting some racial powers.</p>'
							+'<p>The system supports single-class and multi-class characters.  Classes must be entered in the appropriate fields on the Character Sheet - if using the <b>CommandMaster API</b>, the --abilities or --class-menu commands can be used to set the classes and levels of characters and NPCs.  Classes and levels affect spell casting ability, ability to do two-weapon attacks with or without penalty, and the ability to backstab and the related modifiers, among other things.  Class and level also determine valid weapons, armour, shields, some magic items and saves.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> the appropriate fields must be used for relevant classes - this varies by character sheet.  E.g. on the Advanced D&D 2e Character Sheet, Fighter classes must be in the first class column, Wizard classes in the second column, Priest classes in the third, Rogues in the fourth, and Psions (or any others) in the fifth.  If manually adding classes, it is important that these locations are adhered to.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> classes of Fighter and Rogue (such as Rangers and Bards) that can use clerical &/or wizard spells will automatically be allowed to cast spells once they reach the appropriate level by the specific game version rules, but not before.  They <b><u>do not</b></u> need to have levels set in the corresponding spell-caster columns - the casting ability & level is worked out by the system</p>'
							+'<p>The Class-DB database holds definitions of the classes and class rules distributed with the system.  If the MagicMaster API is loaded, use the !magic --extract-db Class-DB command to extract the database to a character sheet to examine and update the class rules.  Examples of Classes currently supported are:</p>'
							+'<table><thead><tr><td>Fighter classes</td><td>Wizard Classes</td><td>Priest Classes</td><td>Rogue Classes</td></tr></thead>'
							+'<tr><td>Warrior</td><td>Wizard</td><td>Priest</td><td>Rogue</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Fighter</td><td>Mage</td><td>Cleric</td><td>Thief</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Abjurer</td><td>Druid</td><td>Bard</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Paladin</td><td>Conjurer</td><td>Healer</td><td>Assassin</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Beastmaster</td><td>Diviner</td><td>Priest of Life</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>Enchanter</td><td>Priest of War	</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Defender (Dwarven)</td><td>Illusionist</td><td>Priest of Light</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td> </td><td>Invoker</td><td>Priest of Knowledge</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td> </td><td>Necromancer</td><td>Shaman</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td> </td><td>Transmuter</td></tr></table>'
							+'<p>The level for each class must be entered in the corresponding field.  Multiple classes and levels can be entered, and will be dealt with accordingly.  Generally, the most beneficial outcome for any combination will be used.  </p>'
							+'<h3>6. Magic Items and Equipment</h3>'
							+'<p>All magic items and standard equipment, including weapons, armour, lanterns etc, are held in the Items table, which by default is set to the potions table, <i>repeating_potions</i>, on the Character Sheet.  As with other fields, this can be changed in the <i>\'fields\'</i> object.  The best way to put items into this table is by using the <b>MagicMaster API</b> commands <b>--edit-mi</b> or the GM-only command <b>--gm-edit-mi</b>.  Alternatively, the <b>AttackMaster --edit-weapons</b> command can be used to load weapons, ammunition and armour into the Items table.  It is generally possible to enter item names and quantities directly into the table and use them within the system, but only items that also exist in the supplied databases will actually work fully with the API (i.e. be recognised by the API as weapons, armour, ammo, etc).  Other items can be in the table but will not otherwise be effective.</p>'
							+'<p>Items can be added to the databases.  See the Database Handouts for more information on the databases.</p>'
							+'<h3>7. Weapons and Ammo</h3>'
							+'<p>For the APIs to work fully the melee weapons, damage, ranged weapons and ammo must be selected using the <b>AttackMaster --weapon</b> command to take the weapon \'in hand\'.  This will display a menu to take weapons and shields from the Items table and take them in hand, ready to use.  This automatically fills all the correct fields for the weapons and ammo to make attacks, including many fields that are not displayed.  Entering weapon data directly into the melee weapon, damage, ranged weapon and ammo tables will generally work, but will be overwritten if the --weapon command is used.  Also, some API functions may not work as well or at all.</p>'
							+'<p>For the <b>InitiativeMaster API</b> to support weapon attack actions weapon name, speed and number of attacks are the most important fields.  For the <b>AttackMaster API</b> to support attack rolls, proficiency calculations, ranged attacks, strength and dexterity bonuses, and other aspects of functionality, fill in as many fields as are visible on the character sheet.  When entering data manually, ensure that the row a melee or ranged weapon is in matches the row damage or ammo is entered in the respective tables (there is no need to do this if using AttackMaster functions to take weapons in-hand, as the relevant lines are otherwise linked).</p>'
							+'<h3>8. Weapon Proficiencies</h3>'
							+'<p>Weapon Proficiencies must be set on the Character Sheet.  This is best done by using the <b>CommandMaster API</b> character sheet management functions, but can be done manually.  Both specific weapons and related weapon groups can be entered in the table, and when a Player changes the character\'s weapons in-hand the table of proficiencies will be consulted to set the correct bonuses and penalties.  Weapon specialisation and mastery (otherwise known as double specialisation) are supported by the CommandMaster functions, but can also be set by ticking/selecting the relevant fields on the Character Sheet weapon proficiencies table.  If entered manually, if a weapon or its related weapon group does not appear in the list, it will be assumed to be not proficient. However, if CommandMaster is used to set proficiencies, just having proficiency in a weapon will mean automatic related weapon proficiency in any related weapon.</p>'
							+'<h3>9. Spell books and memorisable spells</h3>'
							+'<p>The best (and easiest) way to give a Character or NPC spells and powers is to use <b>CommandMaster API</b> to add spells and powers to the Character\'s spellbooks, and <b>MagicMaster API</b> to memorise and cast spells and use powers.  However, for the purposes of just doing initiative and selecting which spell to cast in the next round, the spells and powers can be entered manually onto the character sheet.  Spells are held in the relevant section of the Spells table, which by default is set to the character sheet spells table, <i>repeating_spells</i>.  As with other fields, this can be changed in the <i>\'fields\'</i> object.  Note that on the Advanced D&D 2e character sheet Wizard spells, Priest spells & Powers are all stored in various parts of this one very large table.</p>'
							+'<p>If you are just using the character sheet fields to type into, add spells (or powers) to the relevant "Spells Memorised" section (using the [+Add] buttons to add more as required) <b>a complete row at a time</b> (that is add columns before starting the next row).  Enter the spell names into the "Spell Name" field, and "1" into each of the "current" & "maximum" "Cast Today" fields - the API suite <i>counts down</i> to zero on using a spell, so in order for a spell to appear as available (not greyed out) on the initiative menus, the "current" number left must be > 0.  This makes spells consistent with other tables in the system (e.g. potion dose quantities also count down as they are consumed, etc).</p>'
							+'<p>Then, you need to set the "Spell Slots" values on each level of spell to be correct for the level of caster.  Just enter numbers into each of the "Level", "Misc." and "Wisdom" (for Priests) fields, and/or tick "Specialist" for the Wizard levels as relevant.  This will determine the maximum number of spells memorised each day, that will appear in the spells Initiative Menu.  Do the same for Powers using the "Powers Available" field.  As with other fields on the character sheet, each of these fields can be re-mapped by altering the <i>\'fields\'</i> object in the <i>RPGMaster Library</i> API.</p>'
							+'<p>Spells can only be cast if they have macros defined in the spell databases (see Spell Database Handout).  If the <b>CommandMaster API</b> is loaded, the DM can use the tools provided there to manage Character, NPC & creature spell books and granted powers from the provided spell & power databases.</p>'
							+'<p>The spells a spell caster can memorise (what they have in their spell books, or what their god has granted to them) is held as a list of spell names separated by vertical bars \'|\' in the character sheet attribute defined in <i>fields.Spellbook</i> (on the AD&D2E character sheet \'spellmem\') of each level of spell.  On the AD&D2E sheet, the spell books are the large Spell Book text fields at the bottom of each spell level tab.  The spell names used must be identical (though not case sensitive) to the spell ability macro names in the spell databases (hence the hyphens in the names).   So, for example, a 1<sup>st</sup> level Wizard might have the following in their large Wizard Level 1 spell book field:</p>'
							+'<pre>Armour|Burning-Hands|Charm-Person|Comprehend-Languages|Detect-Magic|Feather-fall|Grease|Identify|Light|Magic-Missile|Read-Magic|Sleep</pre>'
							+'<p>Only these spells will be listed as ones they can memorise at level 1.  When they learn new spells and put them in their spell book, this string can be added to just by typing into it.  When they reach 3<sup>rd</sup> level and can have 2<sup>nd</sup> level spells, the following string might be put in the spell book on the Level 2 Wizard spells tab:</p>'
							+'<pre>Alter-Self|Invisibility|Melfs-Acid-Arrow|Mirror-Image|Ray-of-Enfeeblement</pre>'
							+'<p>Again, as they learn more spells and put them in their spell book, just edit the text to add the spells.</p>'
							+'<p>Once these spell books are defined, the DM or Player can use the <b>MagicMaster --mem-spell</b> command (or an action button and associated ability macro on the Character Sheet) to memorise the correct number of these spells in any combination and store those on the Character Sheet.</p>'
							+'<h3>10. Powers</h3>'
							+'<p>Powers are defined in the Powers database - see Database handouts - though it is possible to use Wizard or Priest spells as powers.  If the <b>CommandMaster API</b> is also loaded, the DM can use the tools provided there to manage Character, NPC & creature spellbooks and granted powers.</p>'
							+'<p>Powers work in an almost identical way to Wizard & Priest spells, except that there is only 1 level of powers.  Powers that the character has are added to the spell book on the Powers tab in the same way as spells, and then memorised using the <b>--mem-spell</b> command (which also works for powers with the right parameters).  If you want to add Wizard or Priest spells as powers that can be used one or more times a day, or at will, the <b>CommandMaster</b> token setup  spellbook function allows spells to be added to the powers spellbook. Otherwise, just add the name of the spell with a prefix of "MU-" or "PR-" manually to the powers spellbook e.g. to add a Wizard Light spell as a power, add it to the powers spellbook as "MU-Light". Spells added in this way can be memorised as powers in exactly the same way as other powers.</p>'

							+'<h1>Weapon and Armour Databases</h1>'
							+'<h6><i>for AttackMaster v'+version+'</i> and later</h6>'
							+'<h2>1. General Database information</h2>'
							+'<p>The RPGMaster APIs use a number of databases to hold Ability Macros defining weapons, ammo, and items of armour and their specifications, defined in the RPGMaster Library for various game versions. Previous versions of the RPGMaster series of APIs held their databases all externally as character sheets: from this version onwards this is not the case for databases supplied with the APIs, which are now held internally to the APIs. However, the AttackMaster or MagicMaster API command <b>--extract-db</b> can be used to extract any or all standard databases to Character Sheets for examination and update. DMs can add their own weapons, ammo and armour to additional databases held as Character Sheets. Additional databases should be named as follows:</p>'
							+'<table><tr><td>Weapons:</td><td>additional databases: MI-DB-Weapons-[added name] where [added name] can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Ammo:</td><td>additional databases: MI-DB-Ammo-[added name] where [added name] can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Armour:</td><td>additional databases: MI-DB-Armour-[added name] where [added name] can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr></table>'
							+'<p><b>However:</b> the system will ignore any database with a name that includes a version number of the form "v#.#" where # can be any number or group of numbers e.g. MI-DB v2.13 will be ignored.  This is so that the DM can version control their databases, with only the current one (without a version number) being live.</p>'
							+'<p>There can be as many additional databases as you want.  Other Master series APIs come with additional databases, some of which overlap - this does not cause a problem as version control and merging unique macros is managed by the APIs.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> all Character Sheet databases <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> have their <i>\'ControlledBy\'</i> value (found under the [Edit] button at the top right of each sheet) set to <i>\'All Players\'</i>.  This must be for all databases, both those provided (set by the API) and any user-defined ones.  Otherwise, Players will not be able to run the macros contained in them.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> databases extracted using the <b>--extract-db</b> command will be able to be edited, but will also slow the system down - the versions held internally in the APIs are much faster for the system to access. Once any extracted database has been examined, it is best to delete them and use the <b>--check-db</b> to re-index the databases so the system operates as fast as possible.</p>'
							+'<p>Each database has a similar structure, with:</p>'
							+'<ul><li>Ability Macros named as the weapon, ammo or armour specified, and used to describe and provide specifications for using the commands with the AttackMaster API;</li>'
							+'<li>Custom Attributes with the attribute name "ct-ability-macro-name", one per Ability Macro, which defines the speed and type for each item;</li>'
							+'<li>An entry in a list on the character sheet in the spell book of the relevant Character Sheet tab (various spell books for different items - see entry below);</li>'
							+'<li>Optionally, some entries come also with attributes that define Powers and Spells delivered by or stored on the item.</li></ul>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> a DM only needs to program the Ability Macro using the formats shown in the next section, and then run the <b>!attk --check-db</b> or <b>!magic --check-db</b> command, which will correctly parse the ability macro and set the rest of the database entries as needed.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability Macros can be whatever the DM wants and can be as simple or as complex as desired. Roll Templates are very useful when defining ability macros - the RPGMaster Library provides several new Roll Templates that do not rely on any particular Character Sheet: <i>RPGMweapon, RPGMammo, and RPGMarmour</i> are the most relevant. See the RPGMaster Library help handout for further information.  When a Player or an NPC or Monster views the specifications of a weapon, ammunition or piece of armour, the APIs run the relevant Ability Macro from the databases as if it had been run by the Player from the chat window.  All Roll20 functions for macros are available.</p>'
							+'<h3>1.1 Replacing Provided Weapons</h3>'
							+'<p>If you want to replace any item provided in any of the databases, you can do so simply by creating an Ability Macro in one of your own databases with exactly the same name as the provided item to be replaced.  The API gives preference to Ability Macros in user-defined databases, so yours will be selected in preference to the one provided with the APIs.</p>'
							+'<h2>2. Weapon & Ammunition Databases</h2>'
							+'<p>Weapon databases are all character sheets that have names that start with MI-DB-Weapon (though in fact, weapons can be in any database starting with MI-DB- if desired), and can have anything put at the end, though those with version numbers of the form v#.# as part of the name will be ignored.  Ammunition databases are similar, with the root database MI-DB-Ammo.</p>'
							+'<p>As previously stated, each weapon definition has 3 (or 4) parts in the database (see Section 1): an Ability Macro with a name that is unique and matches the weapon, an Attribute with the name of the Ability Macro preceded by "ct-", a listing in the database character sheet of the ability macro name separated by \'|\' along with other weapons, and sometimes Attributes defining powers given by, or spells stored on the item. The quickest way to understand these entries is to examine existing entries.  Do extract the root databases and take a look (but remember to delete them after exploring the items in them, so as not to slow the system down unnecessarily).</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> The DM creating new weapons does not need to worry about anything other than the Ability Macro in the database, as running the <b>AttackMaster</b> or <b>MagicMaster -check-db MI-DB-Weapons</b> command will update all other aspects of the database appropriately for all databases that have a name starting with or including <i>\'MI-DB-Weapons\'</i>, as long as the <i>Specs</i> and <i>Data</i> fields are correctly defined. Use the parameter <i>\'MI-DB-Ammo\'</i> to check and update the ammunition databases.  Running the command <b>-check-db</b> with no parameters will check and update all databases.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability macros can be added to a database just by using the [+Add] button at the top of the Abilities column in the Attributes and Abilities tab of the Database Character Sheet, and then using the edit "pencil" icon on the new entry to open it for editing.  Ability macros are standard Roll20 functionality and not dependent on the API.  Refer to the Roll20 Help Centre for more information.</p>'
							+'<p>Here are some examples:</p>'
							+'<h3>Longsword</h3>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;">&{template:RPGMweapon}{{name=Longsword}} {{subtitle=Sword}}{{Speed=[[5]]}} {{Size=Medium}}{{Weapon=1-handed melee long-blade}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[Longsword,Melee,1H,Long-blade]</mark>{{To-hit=+0 + Str bonus}}<mark style="color:blue">ToHitData=[w:Longsword, sb:1, +:0, n:1, ch:20, cm:1, sz:M, ty:S, r:5, sp:5]</mark>{{Attacks=1 per round + level & specialisation, Slashing}}{{Damage=+0, vs SM:1d8, L:1d12, + Str bonus}}<mark style="color:red">DmgData=[w:Longsword, sb:1, +:0, SM:1d8, L:1d12]</mark>{{desc=This is a normal sword. The blade is sharp and keen, but nothing special.}}</p>'
							+'<p>The ability specification for this Longsword uses a Roll20 Roll Template, in this case defined in the RPGMaster Library (see the help handout for the Library to review the specifications of this template), but any Roll Template you desire can be used.  The entries in the Roll Template itself can be anything you desire, giving as much or as little information as you want.  However, the important elements for the APIs are those highlighted.  Each of these elements are inserted <i>between</i> the elements of the Roll Template, meaning they will not be seen by the player when the macro is run.  Generally spaces, hyphens and underscores in the data elements are ignored, and case is not significant.  Each element is described below:</p>'

Clearly, there are some exceptions like a Basterd Sword which is designed to be used as either 1-handed or 2-handed and gains extra damage from doing so.</p>'
							+'<b>However:</b> certain 1-handed weapons gain benefits when a character has proficiency in the <i>Two-Hander Fighting Style</i>, and perhaps with other (custom) fighting styles the DM chooses to set up. However, those without these proficiencies should not gain benefit from 2-handed use of these weapons. To achieve this outcome, these weapons need to be specified in a particular fashion in the Weapons Database.  Here is an example:</p>'
							+'<h3>Battle Axe</h3>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;">&{template:RPGMweapon}{{name=Battle Axe}} {{subtitle=Axe}} {{Speed=[[7]]}} {{Size=Medium}} {{Weapon=1-handed melee axe}} <mark style="color:green">Specs=[Battle-Axe,Melee,1H,Axe],[Battle-Axe,Melee,2H,Axe]</mark> {{To-hit=+0 + Str Bonus}} <mark style="color:blue">ToHitData=[w:Battle Axe,sb:1,+:0,n:1,ch:20,cm:1,sz:M,ty:S,r:5,sp:7,rc:uncharged]</mark> {{Attacks=1 per round + specialisation & level, Slashing}} {{Damage=+0, SM:1d8, L:1d12 + Str Bonus}} DmgData=[w:Battle Axe,sb:1,+:0,SM:1d8,L:1d12] {{desc=A standard Battle Axe of good quality, but nothing special}}</p>'
							+'<p>Here it can be seen that there are two data sets specified for the <i>Specs</i> field and only one data set specified for the <i>ToHitData</i>. Doing this tells the APIs that this weapon can be taken in both hands, but generally will not gain any different advantages. If a Character is proficient or specialised in Two-Hander Fighting Style, however, the APIs will see that this is a 1-handed weapon held in both hands, and allocate it the correct benefits. But only certain weapons gain these benefits, so only certain weapons in the database should be set up this way.</p>'

							+'<h2>3. Armour Databases</h2>'
							+'<p>Armour databases are all character sheets that have names that start with MI-DB-Armour (as with weapons, this can be in any database starting with MI-DB- if desired), and can have anything put at the end, though those with version numbers of the form v#.# as part of the name will be ignored.</p>'
							+'<p>As previously stated and as per the weapon and ammunition databases, each armour definition has 3 parts in the database (see Section 1): the Ability Macro, the ct- attribute, and the listing (and occasionally attributes for powers and spells).  The quickest way to understand these entries is to examine existing entries.  Do extract to the root databases and take a look (but remember to delete them after examination and use the --check-db command to re-index the databases).</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b>The DM creating new armour entries does not need to worry about anything other than the Ability Macro in the database, as running the <b>!attk --check-db MI-DB-Armour</b> or <b>!magic --check-db MI-DB-Armour</b> command will update all other aspects of the database appropriately for all databases that have a name starting with or including \'MI-DB-Armour\', as long as the Specs and Data fields are correctly defined.  Running the command <b>-check-db</b> with no parameters will check and update all databases.</p>'

A <i>buckler</i> is a special type of very small shield that is strapped to the arm and can counter only 1 blow per melee round, but allows both (all) hands to be free.  In fact, any shield can have this functionality if desired, by setting the handedness field of the Specs section to be \'0H\', meaning it take no hands to hold it.</p>'

							+'<h1>Spell, Power & Magic Item Databases</h1>'
							+'<h6><i>for MagicMaster v'+version+' and later</i></h6>'
							+'<h2>1. General Database information</h2>'
							+'<p>The RPGMaster APIs use a number of databases to hold Macros defining character classes, spells, powers and magic items and their effects. Previous versions of the RPGMaster series of APIs held their databases all externally as character sheets: from this version onwards this is not the case for databases supplied with the APIs, which are now held internally to the APIs. However, the AttackMaster or MagicMaster API command <b>--extract-db</b> can be used to extract any or all standard databases to Character Sheets for examination and update. The APIs are distributed with many class, spell, power & magic item definitions, and DMs can add their own character classes, spells, items, weapons, ammo and armour to additional databases in their own database character sheets, with new definitions for database items held in Ability Macros. Additional database character sheets should be named as follows:</p>'
							+'<table>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Wizard Spells:</th><td>additional databases: MU-Spells-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Priest Spells:</th><td>additional databases: PR-Spells-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Powers:</th><td>additional databases: Powers-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Magic Items:</th><td>additional databases: MI-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Character Classes:</th><td>additional databases: Class-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Character Races:</th><td>additional databases: Race-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Attack Calculations:</th><td>additional databases: Attacks-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Fighting Styles:</th><td>additional databases: Styles-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'</table>'
							+'<p><b>However:</b> the system will ignore any database with a name that includes a version number of the form "v#.#" where # can be any number or group of numbers e.g. MI-DB v2.13 will be ignored.  This is so that the DM can version control their databases, with only the current one (without a version number) being live.</p>'
							+'<p>There can be as many additional databases as you want. Other Master series APIs come with additional databases, some of which overlap - this does not cause a problem as version control and merging unique macros is managed by the APIs.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> all Character Sheet databases <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> have their <i>\'ControlledBy\'</i> value (found under the [Edit] button at the top right of each sheet) set to <i>\'All Players\'</i>.  This must be for all databases, both those provided (set by the API) and any user-defined ones.  Otherwise, Players will not be able to run the macros contained in them.</p>'
							+'<p>Each added database has a similar structure, with:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+'	<li>Ability Macros named as the class, spell, power or magic item specified, and used to describe and provide effects for classes, spells, powers and magic items using the commands in the RPGMaster APIs;</li>'
							+'	<li>Custom Attributes with the attribute name "ct-ability-macro-name", one per Ability Macro, which defines the casting time and casting cost for spells & powers, and speed and MI type for magic items (not currently used for Class or Attack definitions);</li>'
							+'	<li>An entry in a list on the character sheet in the spell book of the relevant Character Sheet tab (Spell Level of the spell defined, Powers tab, or various spell books for different Classes & Magic Items - see Class entry below).</li>'
							+'</ul>'
							+'<p>However, as with all other Databases in the RPGMaster Suite of APIs, if the <i>Ability Macros</i> are correctly set up using the formats detailed in the Help Documentation, the <b>MagicMaster API</b> command <b>!magic --check-db database-name</b> will check the database and set up all other aspects for you, including the correct Custom Attributes and List entries.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability Macros can be whatever the DM wants and can be as simple or as complex as desired. Roll Templates are very useful when defining class, spell, power and magic item ability macros, and are an essential part of Attack Templates.  When a Player or an NPC or Monster makes an attack, the AttackMaster API runs the relevant Ability Macro from the databases as if it had been run by the Player from the chat window.  All Roll20 functions for macros are available.</p>'
							+'<h3>1.1 Replacing Database Items</h3>'
							+'<p>If you want to replace any Ability Macro provided in any of the databases, you can do so simply by creating an Ability Macro in one of your own databases (a database with the same root name) with the Ability Macro you create having exactly the same name as the provided item to be replaced.  The API gives preference to Ability Macros in user-defined databases, so yours will be selected in preference to the one provided with the APIs.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>2. Spells and Powers Databases</h2>'
							+'<p>Spells/Powers databases have names that start with</p>'
							+'<p>	<b>Wizard Spells:</b>	MU-Spells-DB-[added name]<br>'
							+'	<b>Priest Spells:</b>	PR-Spells-DB-[added name]<br>'
							+'	<b>Powers:</b>			Powers-DB-[added name]</p>'
							+'<p>Those with version numbers of the form v#.# as part of the name will be ignored.</p>'
							+'<p>As previously stated, each spell or power definition has 3 parts in the database (see Section 1): an Ability Macro with a name that is unique and matches the spell or power, an Attribute with the name of the Ability Macro preceded by "ct-", and a listing in the database character sheet of the ability macro name separated by \'|\' along with others of the same level in the spell book of the level of the spell or power.  The quickest way to understand these entries is to examine existing entries.  Do extract the root databases using the <b>!magic --extract-db</b> command, and take a look (but remember to delete it after viewing to speed things up, and then reindex the databases using <b>!magic --check-db</b>)</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> The DM creating new spells and powers does not need to worry about anything other than the Ability Macro in the database, as running the command <b><i>--check-db</i></b> will update all other aspects of the database appropriately for all databases, as long as the Specs and Data fields are correctly defined. Use the name of the particular database as a parameter to check and update just that database.  Running the command <b><i>--check-db</i></b> with no parameters will check and update all databases.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability macros can be added to a database just by using the [+Add] button at the top of the Abilities column in the Attributes and Abilities tab of the Database Character Sheet, and then using the edit "pencil" icon on the new entry to open it for editing.  Ability macros are standard Roll20 functionality and not dependent on the API.  Refer to the Roll20 Help Centre for more information.</p>'
							+'<h3>2.1 Simple Spells</h3>'
							+'<p><b>The Ability Macro</b> for a spell may look something like this:</p>'

							+'<p>The ability specification for this Sleep spell uses a Roll20 Roll Template, in this case provided by the RPGMaster Library (see the documentation for the RPGMaster Library for specifications of this Roll Template), but any Roll Template you desire can be used.  The entries in the Roll Template itself can be anything you desire, giving as much or as little information as you want.  However, the important elements for the MagicMaster API are those highlighted.  In red, two API buttons grant the player access to run RoundMaster API commands to show the Area of Effect of the spell, and then to mark affected tokens with a "Sleepy" status.</p>'
							+'Each of the elements important to the database are inserted between the elements of the Roll Template, meaning they will not be seen by the player when the macro is run.

							+'<p>The casting time (or speed) <b>sp:</b> can be negative, meaning it gives a negative modifier to individual initiative (if <b>InitMaster API</b> is being used).

Multiply the number of Rounds it will take to cast by 10, or the number of Turns it will take to cast by 100 (if using the <b>InitMaster API</b> the rounds will be automatically counted down and the spell actually cast in the appropriate round, unless the casting is interrupted).  It can also be a dice roll specification, which will be rolled at the point that a character selects the spell, power or item to use in a particular round, which means the speed can vary from round to round.  E.g. under AD&D2e rules, potions are always of this nature (see the AD&D2e DMG p141).</p>'
							+'<p>The cost of material components, <b>gp:</b>, is deducted from the Caster\'s money on their Character Sheet each time the spell is cast.  The GM is informed of the spell being cast, by whom, and how much money it cost and how much money the Caster has left for each casting.</p>'

In addition to the explanation here, please refer to the Weapon and Armour Database Help for more information on these sections.</p>'
							+'<p>In this case, there are multiple repeating datasets in each data section: there are three possible variants of the Spiritual Hammer depending on the caster\'s level.

							+'<p>In each case, the minimum and maximum are separated by a colon, and either can be left out meaning there is no minimum or no maximum.

The mere presence of the character is not enough--a touch of drama from the character is important. Speech and gestures are important, so the character must have his hands free and be in a position to speak. However, turning is not like spellcasting and is not interrupted if the character is attacked during the attempt.<br>'
							+'To resolve a turning attempt, look on Table 61. Cross-index the Hit Dice or type of the undead with the level of the character (two levels lower for a paladin). If there is a number listed, roll 1d20. If the number rolled is equal to or greater than that listed, the attempt is successful. If the letter "T" (for "turned") appears, the attempt is automatically successful without a die roll. If the letter "D" (for "dispel") is given, the turning utterly destroys the undead. A dash (--) means that a priest or paladin of that level cannot turn that type of undead. A successful turn or dispel affects 2d6 undead.

							+'<p>As previously stated and as for other magic, each magic item definition has 3 parts in the database (see Section 1): an Ability Macro with a name that is unique and identifies the magic item, an Attribute with the name of the Ability Macro preceded by "ct-", and a listing in the database character sheet of the ability macro name separated by \'|\' along with others of the same magic item type, which is one of: Potion, Scroll, Rod/Stave/Wand, Weapon, Armour, Ring, Miscellaneous, and also DM Only magic items.  The quickest way to understand these entries is to examine existing entries.  Do extract a root database using the <b>!magic --extract-db</b> command and take a look (but remember to delete it after viewing to speed things up, and then reindex the databases using <b>!magic --check-db</b>)</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> The DM creating new magic items does not need to worry about anything other than the Ability Macro in the database, as running the command <b><i>--check-db</i></b> will update all other aspects of the database appropriately for all databases, as long as the Specs and Data fields are correctly defined. Use the name of the particular database as a parameter to check and update just that database.  Running the command <b><i>--check-db</i></b> with no parameters will check and update all databases.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability macros can be added to a database just by using the [+Add] button at the top of the Abilities column in the Attributes and Abilities tab of the Database Character Sheet, and then using the edit "pencil" icon on the new entry to open it for editing.

An example of how to define an item to make it easy to hide its details is </p>'

Or perhaps a monster could appear and attack all creatures in sight.}}</p>'
							+'<p>Four elements contribute to the "simple" approach to being able to hide the item details from the Player / Character:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+	'<li>The splitting of the title & name of the definition: title is always displayed, and name is only added to the title when hidden details are made displayable by the GM.</li>'
							+	'<li>The optional addition of the <b>st:</b> attribute in the <i>MiscData</i> specification, which specifies the name of the item displayed on buttons while details are hidden. If not specified, defaults to the item class.</li>'
							+	'<li>The addition of the <i>Looks Like</i> tag which marks text that replaces the <i>desc</i>ription while details are hidden and until the GM reveals the details.</li>'
							+	'<li>The <i>Hide item as other item</i> function in the GM\'s <i>Add Items</i> dialog, which will be available for items that have the <i>Looks Like</i> tag, or for which the GM chooses another item to hide this one as.</p>'
							+'</ul>'
							+'<p>The key element is the inclusion of the <i>Looks Like</i> text tag in the definition of the item. If an item has this tag, the GM\'s <i>Add Items</i> dialog will have the <i>Hide Item as Item</i> button enabled to hide the item as either what the <b>st:</b> data attribute specifies or (if not specified) the item class in the <i>Specs</i> specification of the item. However, if <i>auto-hiding</i> is set in the <b>!magic --config</b> options, an item with a <i>Looks Like</i> text tag will automatically be hidden in this way when added to any container. If a player character views or uses such a hidden item, they will see only the <i>title</i> and the <i>Looks Like</i> text and nothing else. The GM can either set the item to automatically reveal its "secrets" when the player character <i>views</i> the item, <i>uses</i> the item, or only when revealed <i>manually</i> by the GM. It is also possible for the GM to select to hide the item as a completely different item using the <i>Add Items</i> dialog. For full details see the <b>--gm-edit-mi</b> entry in the <i>MagicMaster Help</i> handout.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>4. Magic Items with Powers or Spell-Storing</h2>'
							+'<p>Some magic items, especially artefacts and sentient items, can store spells and/or have powers similar to characters.  MagicMaster supports magic items of this type to a degree, although there are inevitably exceptions that the DM will have to get creative in their development!  These items use API buttons that call various MagicMaster commands to deliver their capabilities.</p>'
							+'<p>First to note is that <b>items that have powers and spells use spell slots in the owning character\'s character sheet</b>.  These spell slots should not be used by characters in your campaign.  If they are, errors might occur.  By default, on the AD&D2E character sheet the system uses Wizard Level 14 spell slots for magic item powers, and Wizard Level 15 spell slots for spell-storing magic items.

The level of each spell is determined by rolling 1d6 (for priests) or 1d8 (for wizards). The number rolled is the level of the spell, as follows:<br>'
							+'Priest: 1d6, if 6 is rolled, roll 1d4 instead.<br>'
							+'Wizard: 1d8, if 8 is rolled, roll 1d6 instead.<br>'
							+'Which spell type of any given level is contained by the ring is also randomly determined.<br>'
							+'The ring empathically imparts to the wearer the names of its spells. Once spell class, level, and type are determined, the properties of the ring are fixed and unchangeable. Once a spell is cast from the ring, it can be restored only by a character of appropriate class and level of experience (i.e., a 12th-level wizard is needed to restore a 6th-level magical spell to the ring). Stored spells have a casting time of [[5]].}}</p>'
							+'<p>This is a specific version of a Ring of Spell Storing as the spells stored are specified in the macro. Alternatively, a blank <i>Ring of Spell Storing</i> is provided in the API Rings database.

Once owned and used, the level of the spell caster is recorded each time a spell is refreshed by casting into the item.  As the item is then passed from one Character to another, or stored in a container and recovered later, the levels at which the spells were cast is retained.  However, if the item is reloaded from the databases, or a duplicate of the item is placed by the DM and found by another character, that version of the item will have the spell caster levels from the database definitions.  Note that if a single Character picks up two versions of exactly the same spell storing item (i.e. with the same item name) the results are unpredicable... The GM should use the <b>--gm-edit-mi</b> menu to rename one or both of the rings to give them unique names.</p>'

							+'<p>Thus, the definition of the particular Bag of Holding defined above, when a character has it in their Items & Equipment and either views or uses the item, will result in a new separate character sheet being created, named "Bag of Holding" (same as the item), placed in the controlling Player\'s journal and marked as controlled by that player, and for one Potion of Healing and two Scrolls of Protection vs. Magic to be inserted automatically into the Bag of Holding, ready for the Character to find and use by dragging the bag onto the map from their Journal and Searching the Bag.</p>'
							+'<p>Once the Bag is created, the existing items can be taken out into the Character\'s own items & equipment, or new ones placed in the bag, the bag passed from one Character to another or itself placed in a different container.</p>'
							+'<p>It is recommended that, where a GM places multiple item-holding items in a campaign, such as multiple Bags of Holding, that the GM uses the functions of the [Add Items] menu to rename each with a different name in the original container to which they are placed and before each is viewed or used (i.e. before the item character sheet is created by the system) - perhaps naming each after some previous owner or its creator.  This prevents confusion with multiple Character Sheets all with the same name (which Roll20 will allow, but can definately be confusing for the GM who will see them all even if players only see the ones they control).</p>'

This will take into account if the armour is valid for the character class, determine which is the best armour combination that the character has, if various armour elements can or can\'t work together, and add in Dexterity bonuses or impairments.  It will also allow magical effects cast on the character to take effect or be adjusted via the token "circles" and highlight when such an effect is in place by showing the relevant token bar (only when there is a difference between the token AC and calculated AC).</p>'

							+'<h1>Character Class & Race Databases</h1>'
							+'<h6><i>for RPGMaster APIs</i></h6>'
							+'<h2>1. General Database information</h2>'
							+'<p>The RPGMaster APIs use a number of databases to hold Macros defining races, creatures, character classes, spells, powers and magic items and their effects. Previous versions of the RPGMaster series of APIs held their databases all externally as character sheets: from this version onwards this is not the case for databases supplied with the APIs, which are now held internally to the APIs. However, the AttackMaster or MagicMaster API command <b>--extract-db</b> can be used to extract any or all standard databases to Character Sheets for examination and update. The APIs are distributed with many class, spell, power & magic item definitions, and DMs can add their own character classes, spells, items, weapons, ammo and armour to additional databases in their own database character sheets, with new definitions for database items held in Ability Macros. Additional database character sheets should be named as follows:</p>'
							+'<table>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Wizard Spells:</th><td>additional databases: MU-Spells-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Priest Spells:</th><td>additional databases: PR-Spells-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Powers:</th><td>additional databases: Powers-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Magic Items:</th><td>additional databases: MI-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Character Classes:</th><td>additional databases: Class-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Races & Creatures:</th><td>additional databases: Race-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Attack Calculations:</th><td>additional databases: Attacks-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'</table>'
							+'<p><b>However:</b> the system will ignore any database with a name that includes a version number of the form "v#.#" where # can be any number or group of numbers e.g. MI-DB v2.13 will be ignored.  This is so that the DM can version control their databases, with only the current one (without a version number) being live.</p>'
							+'<p>There can be as many additional databases as you want. Other Master series APIs come with additional databases, some of which overlap - this does not cause a problem as version control and merging unique macros is managed by the APIs.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> all Character Sheet databases <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> have their <i>\'ControlledBy\'</i> value (found under the [Edit] button at the top right of each sheet) set to <i>\'All Players\'</i>.  This must be for all databases, both those provided (set by the API) and any user-defined ones.  Otherwise, Players will not be able to run the macros contained in them.</p>'
							+'<p>Each added database has a similar structure, with:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+'	<li>Ability Macros named as the class, spell, power or magic item specified, and used to describe and provide effects for classes, spells, powers and magic items using the commands in the RPGMaster APIs;</li>'
							+'	<li>Custom Attributes with the attribute name "ct-ability-macro-name", one per Ability Macro, which defines the casting time and casting cost for spells & powers, and speed and MI type for magic items (not currently used for Class or Attack definitions);</li>'
							+'	<li>An entry in a list on the character sheet in the spell book of the relevant Character Sheet tab (Spell Level of the spell defined, Powers tab, or various spell books for different Classes & Magic Items - see Class entry below).</li>'
							+'</ul>'
							+'<p>Ability Macros can be whatever the DM wants and can be as simple or as complex as desired. Roll Templates are very useful when defining class, spell, power and magic item ability macros.  When a Player or an NPC or Monster views or casts a spell, power or uses a magic item the Magic Master API runs the relevant Ability Macro from the databases as if it had been run by the Player from the chat window.  All Roll20 functions for macros are available.</p>'
							+'<h3>1.1 Replacing Races, Classes, Spells & Items</h3>'
							+'<p>If you want to replace any Ability Macro provided in any of the databases, you can do so simply by creating an Ability Macro in one of your own databases with exactly the same name as the provided item to be replaced.  The API gives preference to Ability Macros in user-defined databases, so yours will be selected in preference to the one provided with the APIs.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>2. Character Class Database</h2>'
							+'<p>The DM can add Character Class databases as character sheets that have names that start with Class-DB. The Class definitions that come with the installed game-version-specific <b>RPGMaster Library</b> can be extracted to a character sheet and viewed by using the <i><b>!magic --extract-db Class-DB</b> or <b>!attk --extract-db Class-DB</b></i> commands.  <b>Note:</b> it is best to delete the extracted Class-DB database character sheet after viewing/using, so that the system uses the much faster internal database version. After deleting or changing any character sheet database, always run the <i><b>!magic --check-db</b> or <b>!attk --check-db</b></i> command to re-index the databases.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Classes:</b>	Class-DB-<i>[added name]</i></p>'
							+'<p>Those with version numbers of the form v#.# as part of the name will be ignored.</p>'
							+'<p>As previously stated, each class definition has 3 parts in the database (see Section 1): an Ability Macro with a name that is unique and matches the Class being defined, an Attribute with the name of the Ability Macro preceded by "ct-", and a listing in the database character sheet of the ability macro name separated by \'|\' along with others of the same base class: the base classes being "Warrior", "Wizard", "Priest", "Rogue", and "Psion".  The quickest way to understand these entries is to examine existing entries.  Do extract the root database using the <b><i>--extract-db</i></b> command and take a look (remember to delete it after viewing - see above)</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> The DM creating new classes does not need to worry about anything other than the Ability Macro in the database, as running the command <b><i>--check-db</i></b> will update all other aspects of the database appropriately for all databases, as long as the Specs and Data fields in the Ability Macros are correctly defined. Use the name of the particular database as a parameter to check and update just that database.  Running the command <b><i>--check-db</i></b> with no parameters will check and update all databases.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability macros can be added to a database just by using the [+Add] button at the top of the Abilities column in the Attributes and Abilities tab of the Database Character Sheet, and then using the edit "pencil" icon on the new entry to open it for editing.  Ability macros are standard Roll20 functionality and not dependent on the API.  Refer to the Roll20 Help Centre for more information.</p>'
							+'<h3>Standard / Simple Class definitions</h3>'

Unlike other undead creatures, the vampire can easily pass among normal men without drawing attention to itself for, although its facial features are sharp and feral, they do not seem inhuman. In many cases, a vampire\'s true nature is revealed only when it attacks. There are ways in which a vampire may be detected by the careful observer, however. Vampires cast no reflection in a glass, cast no shadows, and move in complete silence.}}</p>'

A shaman can cast normal or reversed spells from the *healing, charm, protection, divination*, or *weather* spheres. Frost giant witch doctors are priest/wizards of up to 7th/3rd level; they prefer spells that can bewilder and confound other giants. Favorite spells include: *unseen servant, shocking grasp, detect magic, ventriloquism, deeppockets, ESP, mirror image,* and *invisibility*.}}</p>'
							+'<p>This Witch Doctor has a number of spells specified to be in their spellbook by using the <i>RaceData</i> extension data sets:</p>'
							+'<pre>[cl:MU,lv:1,w:random|random|random|Detect-Magic],[cl:MU,lv:2,w:random|ESP|Mirror-Image|random|random]</pre>'
							+'<p>The <code>cl:MU</code> specifies that this data set specifies spells for the spellbook, and the <code>lv:#</code> specifies the level of spells. The <i>w:</i> string then defines the spell names, separated by pipes \'|\'. These names must be the same as those given in the spells databases (which can be listed using the GMs [Token Setup] / [Add Spells & Powers] dialog), or can be \'random\'. Specifying \'random\' will do what it says on the tin - a random spell will be chosen from all available spells at that level. If more than one spell is stated as \'random\' there is a chance that the same one will come up twice - the APIs will allow this.</p>'
							+'<p>If a spellbook is specified for a creature in this way, it must be of a class that can cast spells or it will not be able to use them. The creature\'s level as a spellcaster will determine how many spells can be memorised at each level, regardless of how many are given in the spellbooks.</p>'
							+'<p>Also, if spellbooks are specified like this the API will automatically <i>memorise</i> spells, selecting spells from the list at random up to the correct number for the creature\'s level. If a creature can cast <i>Wizard</i> spells and <i>no spellbooks</i> are specified, random spells will be memorised from all possible wizard spells that are valid for the schools that caster can cast.  The GM (or other controlling player) can always use the <i>Spells Menu</i> to memorise different spells, and the GM can use the [Token Setup] / [Add Spells & Powers] dialog to change the spellbooks.</p>'
							+'<p>If the creature can cast <i>Priest</i> spells, the creature will be granted a spellbook of all priest spells that are valid for the spheres it can cast, and random spells from this list automatically memorised from this list. The specification can override this behaviour by specifying particuler priest spells to have in the spellbook at a specific level using <code>[cl:PR,lv:#,w:....]</code>. Alternatiely, if the w: is followed by an empty string e.g. <code>[cl:PR,lv:#,w:]</code>, then the correct number of random priest spells will be memorised at each level, but only those memorised spells will be written to the spellbook. An example of this is for dragons, as according to the <i>Monsterous Manual</i> they only know an exclectic mix of spells they have picked up as they age and are not granted spells by a god.</p>'
							+'<h3>4.3 Complex Creatures with Multiple Forms</h3>'
							+'<p>Some creatures, such as Dragons, have multiple forms and also vary within a single form. For example, a Dragon can be Red, Blue, White, Gold, Silver, Crystal, ... etc. Not only that, but each of these dragons\' powers grow with age from Hatchling through Juvenile, Adulthood, to Venerable, Wyrm & Great Wyrm. Rather than create a definition for each age and colour combination (which would result in 180 definitions just for the standard dragons!) it is possible to add a query presented to the GM when selecting the type of creature to <i>drag & drop</i>. This query can specify data to be factored into calculations in the <i>RaceData</i> specification dependent on the selection made.</p>'

							+'<p>In the case of dragons, this query asks the GM for the age to make the dragon, and sets two values based on the age to use in calculations (seen above in red). The query will be applied to all creatures of the Creature Database-Class (Specs definition field 2), in this case any <i>DragonRace</i> creature, even if the roll query is specified in the definition of only 1 such creature. Different roll queries can be specified for different Creature Database-Classes: you can make up your own db-classes to differentiate them.</p>'
							+'<p>The query specification in the Data section has the following syntax:</p>'
							+'<pre>query:What Age?|Hatchling%%1%%-6|Very Young%%2%%-4|Young%%3%%-2|Juvenile%%4%%0|Young Adult%%5%%1|Adult%%6%%2|Mature Adult%%7%%3|Old%%8%%4|Very Old%%9%%5|Venerable%%10%%6|Wyrm%%11%%7|Great Wyrm%%12%%8</pre>'
							+'<p>If you are familiar with Roll20 Roll Queries, you will note that the ?{...} has been left out: only the text between the braces is defined. This text starts with the query text to be presented to the GM - "What Age?". Possible answers are then specified, separated by pipes \'|\'. Each answer has text followed by values separated by double-percents \'%%\'. The text will be displayed in the roll query to the GM to select the option. The percent-separated values will be returned by the query, including the text as the first value.</p>'
							+'<p>It is then possible to refer to the returned values in the <i>RaceData</i> specification using the syntax <code>??#</code>, where # is the zero-based number of the value - ??0 is the text of the option selected, ??1 the next value, ??2 the value after that, etc. An example of this is given in the new <code>age=??0:??1</code> data specification in red above, which will set the character sheet "age" field to the text of the dragon\'s age selected by the GM, and the sheet "age|max" field to the ??1 parameter, which is the "age value" of that age of dragon.</p>'
							+'<p>It is possible to do simple maths using these values and others in the data specification. The API supports plus (+), minus (-), times (*), divide (/), left & right parenthesis (()), max (^(...;...)), min (v(...;...)), dice rolls (#d#+#r#), and ranges (#:#). These operators can be combined in simple ways - to be honest, I\'ve not tested all possible combinations - keep it simple and it should work! An example is the calculation for magic resistance:</p>'
							+'<pre>mr=(v(^((??1-4);0);1)*??1*5)</pre>'
							+'<p>The order of calculation is:</p>'
							+'<ol><li>the two instances of <i>??1</i> will be replaced by the first value after the selected text in the roll query,</li>'
							+'<li>then the parentheses that hold numbers are calculated (??1-4),</li>'
							+'<li>then any ranges are resolved by rolling a number in the range (none here),</li>'
							+'<li>next dice rolls are made (none here),</li>'
							+'<li>then the max & min are resolved and</li>'
							+'<li>the final parentheses calculated.</li></ol>'
							+'<p><b>Ranges:</b> These are specified with two numbers separated by a colon, thus <code>##:##</code>. E.g. 3:18 - The API will attempt to roll any range by using the Roll20 dice roller, with 3 dice if possible (so that standard attribute rolls of NPCs and creatures are as close to real as possible). Thus, 3:18 is rolled using 3d6, 6:15 will be 3d4+3, 5:17 is 3d5+2. If a range is too small or cannot be done with 3 dice, 2 or 1 will be used instead, so 2:4 will be 1d3+1, 15:16 will be 1d2+14 etc. If you want more control, specify a particular dice roll.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Dice Rolls:</b> can be specified using the syntax <code>#d#+#r#</code> or <code>#d#-#r#</code>: all parts except the #d# are optional. The r# specifies a re-roll number - if any dice roll is equal to or less than the r# number, that dice alone will be rerolled until the value is higher. <b>Note:</b> The Hit Dice specification (hd=) can use a format like <code>#d#</code> or <code>#d#+#</code> or <code>#d#+#r#</code> (the plus can be a minus), or can be extended to <code>#d#+#d#r#</code> (i.e. the roll modifier can be a dice roll itself) - but the reroll value always applies to the main dice roll. Avoid other maths for the Hit Dice value, but ??# substitutions and maths on the <i>number of dice</i> are possible e.g. <code>(??1+9)d8+??2r2</code> is valid.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Min & Max:</b> The operators ^ (caret - max) and v (lower-case V - min) can be used with the syntax <code>^(#;#;#)</code> or <code>v(#;#;#;#)</code> (any number of values is valid) and will evaluate to the maximum or minimum value respectively. Note that a semi-colon separator \';\' is used rather than a comma.</p>'
							+'<p>So now it can be seen that the Magic Resistance calculation above will resolve to 0 if the ??1 value is 4 or less, or (5 times ??1) if ??1 is 5 or more. The combination of the Roll Query, values set by the answer to it, and the simple maths engine can provide powerful results.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> semi-colons are used for min & max seperators, and square brackets avoided for calculations, so that Roll20 calculations are not inappropriately triggered when the Roll Templates are displayed and so that these calculations can be passed in API calls.  Use these forms of maths in creature definition data specifications, and not Roll20 calculations, to avoid issues. Roll20 calculations can be used <i>inside</i> {{...}} parts of Roll Templates as these will never be encountered by the API management functions, including in API button calls.</p>'

							+'<h1>Attacks Database</h1>'
							+'<h6><i>for RPGMaster APIs</i></h6>'
							+'<h2>1. General Database information</h2>'
							+'<p>The RPGMaster APIs use a number of databases to hold Macros defining character classes, spells, powers and magic items and their effects. Previous versions of the RPGMaster series of APIs held their databases all externally as character sheets: from this version onwards this is not the case for databases supplied with the APIs, which are now held internally to the APIs. However, the AttackMaster or MagicMaster API command <b>--extract-db</b> can be used to extract any or all standard databases to Character Sheets for examination and update. The APIs are distributed with many class, spell, power & magic item definitions, and DMs can add their own character classes, spells, items, weapons, ammo and armour to additional databases in their own database character sheets, with new definitions for database items held in Ability Macros. Additional database character sheets should be named as follows:</p>'
							+'<table>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Wizard Spells:</th><td>additional databases: MU-Spells-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Priest Spells:</th><td>additional databases: PR-Spells-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Powers:</th><td>additional databases: Powers-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Magic Items:</th><td>additional databases: MI-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Character Classes:</th><td>additional databases: Class-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Character Races:</th><td>additional databases: Race-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Attack Calculations:</th><td>additional databases: Attacks-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Fighting Styles:</th><td>additional databases: Styles-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'</table>'
							+'<p><b>However:</b> the system will ignore any database with a name that includes a version number of the form "v#.#" where # can be any number or group of numbers e.g. MI-DB v2.13 will be ignored.  This is so that the DM can version control their databases, with only the current one (without a version number) being live.</p>'
							+'<p>There can be as many additional databases as you want. Other Master series APIs come with additional databases, some of which overlap - this does not cause a problem as version control and merging unique macros is managed by the APIs.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> all Character Sheet databases <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> have their <i>\'ControlledBy\'</i> value (found under the [Edit] button at the top right of each sheet) set to <i>\'All Players\'</i>.  This must be for all databases, both those provided (set by the API) and any user-defined ones.  Otherwise, Players will not be able to run the macros contained in them.</p>'
							+'<p>Each added database has a similar structure, with:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+'	<li>Ability Macros named as the class, spell, power or magic item specified, and used to describe and provide effects for classes, spells, powers and magic items using the commands in the RPGMaster APIs;</li>'
							+'	<li>Custom Attributes with the attribute name "ct-ability-macro-name", one per Ability Macro, which defines the casting time and casting cost for spells & powers, and speed and MI type for magic items (not currently used for Class or Attack definitions);</li>'
							+'	<li>An entry in a list on the character sheet in the spell book of the relevant Character Sheet tab (Spell Level of the spell defined, Powers tab, or various spell books for different Classes & Magic Items - see Class entry below).</li>'
							+'</ul>'
							+'<p>However, as with all other Databases in the RPGMaster Suite of APIs, if the <i>Ability Macros</i> are correctly set up using the formats detailed in the Help Documentation, the <b>AttackMaster API</b> command <b>!attk --check-db database-name</b> will check the database and set up all other aspects for you, including the correct Custom Attributes and List entries.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability Macros can be whatever the DM wants and can be as simple or as complex as desired. Roll Templates are very useful when defining class, spell, power and magic item ability macros, and are an essential part of Attack Templates.  When a Player or an NPC or Monster makes an attack, the AttackMaster API runs the relevant Ability Macro from the databases as if it had been run by the Player from the chat window.  All Roll20 functions for macros are available.</p>'
							+'<h3>1.1 Replacing Database Items</h3>'
							+'<p>If you want to replace any Ability Macro provided in any of the databases, you can do so simply by creating an Ability Macro in one of your own databases (a database with the same root name) with the Ability Macro you create having exactly the same name as the provided item to be replaced.  The API gives preference to Ability Macros in user-defined databases, so yours will be selected in preference to the one provided with the APIs.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>2. How Attacks Work</h2>'
							+'<p>In order to understand the Attacks Database, it is first important to understand how attacks are executed by the <b>AttackMaster API</b>.  Under some (if not all) versions of D&D, and especially <i>AD&D 2nd Edition</i>, attacks are quite complex involving many factors that can vary from moment to moment.  Some say that this is why they prefer RPG systems that require less maths and are faster to execute, that the complexity of the AD&D2e combat system interrupts the flow of play.  The AttackMaster API handles attacks in such a way as to hide as much of that complexity from the players as possible, and thus allow game-play to flow and players to concentrate on the unfolding story.</p>'
							+'<p>In order for the API to achieve this, it must evaluate many factors "on the fly" such as current magical effects in place (generally or on individuals), the current attributes of a character (which can vary as they are affected by game play), the type, range and properties of the weapon combinations used at that point in time for that particular attack, and the effects of the race, class, level and proficiency of the character, among several others.  Given that these factors can vary even during a single round, each attack must be fully evaluated from scratch each time it is made.</p>'
							+'<p>Another issue is introduced by players feeling much more satisfied if they can see dice rolling for the attack, or they may want to use the Roll20 dice rolling mouse action, or even their own physical dice.  Unfortunately for API authors, at the time of writing the API it is only possible to display rolling 3D dice from Chat Window dice rolls, either typed in the entry box by the player or run from Macros displayed in the Chat Window - 3D dice will not work when called by or included in API calls and commands.</p>'
							+'<p>So how does the AttackMaster API achieve 3D dice rolls and attack calculations that can accelerate game-play?  The answer is that it uses Attack Template definitions which it parses and turns into Ability Macros on the Character Sheet of the character that selects to do an attack.  The Melee Weapon templates are parsed and the attack Ability Macros for each Melee weapon in-hand created on the Character Sheet as (in fact just before) the Attack chat window menu is displayed, and Ranged Weapon templates are parsed and their attack Ability Macros are created after the type of Ammo has been selected and just before the relevant range buttons on the Attack menu are enabled for the Player to select.  Monster attack templates are parsed just before the Monster Attack menu is shown, with a template "set" created for each defined Monster <i>innate</i> attack on the Monster character sheet tab.  When the Player selects a Melee weapon to attack with, or the relevant range button for a Ranged weapon or Monster attack, the API is then not actually involved at all - the Roll20 Chat Window button just selected is just doing a standard macro call to the relevant attack Ability Macro just created on the Character Sheet.  This also means the actual attacks happen at the fastest speed Roll20 can achieve as no API code is being run at that point.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>3. The Attacks Database</h2>'
							+'<p>The Attack Templates are stored in the internal API Attacks Database, which can be exposed in Character Sheet Database form as <i>Attacks-DB</i> using the AttackMaster <b>!attk --extract-DB Attacks-DB</b> command. Attack Templates can also exist in additional bespoke Attacks Databases the DM/Game Creator adds using the Character Sheet name <i>Attacks-DB-[added name]</i>.  There are 12 basic Attack Templates:</p>'
							+'<table>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">MW-ToHit</th><td>Melee Weapon calculation to assess and display the Armour Class hit by an attack</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">MW-DmgSM</th><td>Melee Weapon calculation to assess the damage done to a Medium or smaller opponent if the hit was sucessful</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">MW-DmgL</th><td>Melee Weapon calculation to assess the damage done to Large or larger opponents as a result of a successful hit</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">MW-Targeted-Attk</th><td>Melee Weapon calculation for using a targeted attack which rolls all attack and damage dice at once, and then displays the AC hit, the damage vs. all types of opponents, and the current AC & HP of the targeted opponent</td></tr>'

							+'	<tr><th scope="row">RW-Targeted-Attk</th><td>Ranged Weapon calculation for using a targeted attack which rolls all attack and damage dice at once, and then displays the AC hit, the damage vs. all types of opponents, and the current AC & HP of the targeted opponent</td></tr>'

							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Mon-Targeted-Attk</th><td>Monster/Creature for a targeted attack calculation to assess and display the Armour Class hit and damage done by an attack, along with the target\'s current AC and HP</td></tr>'
							+'</table>'
							+'<p>The Melee Weapon Attack Templates will be parsed for each Melee Weapon in-hand at the time of the attack, and the Ranged Weapon Attack Templates will be parsed for each possible range of the Ranged Weapon/Ammo combination selected for the attack.  Two additional Melee Weapon Attack Templates are parsed if the character making the attack is a Rogue class:</p>'
							+'<table>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">MW-Backstab-DmgSM</th><td>Melee Weapon calculation to assess the damage done to a Medium or smaller opponent if the hit was a Rogue doing a backstab and the attack was successful</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">MW-Backstab-DmgL</th><td>Melee Weapon calculation to assess the damage done to a Large or larger opponent if the hit was a Rogue doing a backstab and the attack was successful</td></tr>'
							+'</table>'
							+'<p>All of the above templates are provided in the Attacks-DB database supplied with the game version-specific RPGMaster Library API.  They are created to follow the rules of the game version supported by that specific library: DMs and Game Creators can create their own attack and damage calculations following whatever rules they want in their own bespoke Attacks Database, using the information provided in the next section.</p>'
							+'<p>It is possible to add additional Attack Templates that are specific to particular Races, Classes, or even individual weapons!  Indeed, the database supplied includes an example of a bespoke Attack Template set for a thrown prepared Oil Flask.  When an attack is the action selected by the Player, the API will search the Attacks-DB and bespoke user Attacks Databases for Melee and Ranged Attack Templates in the following name order (replace the ?W with either MW or RW as appropriate):</p>'
							+'<ol>'
							+'	<li><b>?W-ToHit-\< weapon name \> </b> Searches for a weapon-specific Attack Template set for the weapon being used to attack with, but if not found then</li>'
							+'	<li><b>?W-ToHit-\< class name \> </b> Searches for a class-specific Attack Template set for the class (or each class of a multi/dual class) of the attacking character, but if not found then</li>'
							+'	<li><b>?W-ToHit-\< race \> </b> Searches for a race-specific Attack Template set for the race of the attacking character, but if not found then</li>'
							+'	<li><b>?W-ToHit</b> Uses the default Attack Template set.</li>'
							+'</ol>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>4. Attack Data Fields</h2>'
							+'<p>Attack Templates can take the form of any message or macro that can be held in a Roll20 Character Sheet Ability Macro and be displayed in the Chat Window when called.  Typically, this will use a Roll Template (standard Roll20 functionality - see Roll20 Help for information), but it can be any format you desire as long as it results in the correct display of information to the Player.</p>'
							+'<p>The Attack Template has a large number of template fields that it can call upon to use in its calculations - these are pre-calculated values supplied by the API that the DM / Game Creator writing a new Attack Template can use.  The standard Roll20 attribute value notation of @{selected|field-name} is not recommended for use in Attack Templates, as when the template is parsed, and then later the resulting Ability Macro run as part of the attack, there are circumstances where the token for the attacking Character may not be currently selected, resulting in the wrong value being used or, worse, an error occurring and the game halting.  Instead, all the following template fields are available:</p>'

							+'<h2>5. Character (PC & NPC) Attack Templates</h2>'
							+'<p>As previously described, the Attacks Database contains Attack Templates as Ability Macro entries.  For Characters and NPCs that attack using weapons "in-hand" (see AttackMaster API documentation for information on taking weapons "in-hand"), four standard Attack Templates are required: -ToHit; -DmgSM; -DmgL; and -Targeted-Attk.</p>'
							+'<h3>5.1 The "To Hit" Template</h3>'
							+'<p>A standard <i>To Hit</i> Attack Template looks like this (the example is for the AD&D2e version):</p>'
							+'<h4>MW-ToHit</h4>'

							+'<p>The four fields in the <i>Specs</i> data are the standard four used in all Specs fields: Entry Type (MWtoHit), Entry Class (AttackMacro), Handedness (in this case replaced by toHit dice roll spec 1d20), and Entry Supertype (Attack).  The key field to note here is the <b>ToHit Dice Roll Specification</b> (which replaces the <i>Handedness</i> field).  This can be any valid dice roll, and will be used for the <i>^^toHitRoll^^</i> template field if the Player selects Roll20 to roll the attack dice.</p>'
							+'<p>This Attack Template is formatted using a Roll20 Roll Template with a type specified using the <i>^^defaultTemplate^^</i> template field, but need not be - formatting is up to the creator of the Attack Template.  It is important this information is displayed to the right people - Players that control a character, all Players as a public post, or just the DM for attacks by creatures & NPCs.  The <i>^^toWhoPublic^^</i> template field will check if the attacking token represents a Character/NPC/Creature controlled by a Player and, if so, make a public post that all can see, but otherwise just whisper the results of the attack to the DM only.  Similarly, <i>^^toWho^^</i> will whisper the attack information either only to the Player(s) that control the attacking character/creature or, if no one does, then to the DM.</p>'
							+'<p>The rest of the Attack Template defines the calculations using the API supplied data to display the Armour Class value that would be successfully hit by the attacking character, with the selected weapon under the current conditions.  It also defines a display of the adjustments that are made to the dice roll which the Players and DM can hover a mouse over to get an explanation of the calculations.  All the calculations and tag display are standard Roll20 functionality, so once the Attack Template Data Fields are replaced by actual values by the API and the resulting Ability Macro saved to the attacking character\'s Character Sheet, running it like any other Ability Macro will use only Roll20 functionality, and not involve use of the APIs (unless the Attack template specifically includes an API call).</p>'
							+'<p>The Attack Template shown above is a To Hit template for a <b><i>Melee weapon</i></b> attack.  That for a <b><i>Ranged weapon</i></b> attack is very similar, just using some different and ranged attack related Template Fields.</p>'
							+'<h3>5.2 The "Damage" Templates</h3>'
							+'<p>There are always two damage Attack Templates to go with each <i>To Hit</i> Template, typically one for damage to Medium and smaller opponents and one for Large and larger.  However, as will be seen when discussing the <i>Oil Flask</i> bespoke Attack Templates below, those are not always the outcomes of the two damage Templates.  However, they <i>do</i> always start with MW-DmgSM and MW-DmgL for Melee weapon attacks, and RW-DmgSM and RW-DmgL for Ranged weapon attacks (optionally followed by a race, class or weapon name). The standard <i>Damage</i> Attack Template looks like this:</p>'
							+'<h4>MW-DmgSM</h4>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;"><b>^^toWhoPublic^^</b> &{template:<b>^^defaultTemplate^^</b>}{{title=<b>^^tname^^</b> does damage with their <b>^^weapon^^</b>}}{{Subtitle=Melee Attack}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[MWtoHit,AttackMacro,1d20,Attack]</mark>{{AC Hit=@{<b>^^cname^^</b>|ac-hit}}}{{Attk Type=<b>^^weapType^^</b>}}{{Dmg S=[[ ([[<b>^^weapDmgSM^^</b>]][Dice Roll]) + ([[<b>^^strDmgBonus^^</b>*<b>^^weapStrDmg^^</b>]][Strength+]) + ([[<b>^^weapDmgAdj^^</b>]][Weapon+]) + ([[<b>^^weapStyleDmgAdj^^</b>+<b>^^weapStyleDmgSM^^</b>]][Style+]) + ([[<b>^^magicDmgAdj^^</b>]][Magic dmg adj]) + ([[<b>^^specProf^^</b>*2]][Specialist+] + [[<b>^^masterProf^^</b>*3]][Mastery+])]]}}{{Dmg L=[Roll](~<b>^^mwLHdmgMacro^^</b>)}}{{Crit Roll=<b>^^weapCritHit^^</b>}}{{Fumble Roll=<b>^^weapCritMiss^^</b>}}</p>'
							+'<p>The damage Attack Template works in the same way as the other Attack Templates as explained above for the <i>ToHit</i> template.  While the <i>Specs</i> data includes the "To Hit" dice roll specification, this is not used in the damage Template, and is irrelevant.  That field just needs to hold something, and a dice roll specification is what is expected.  Hopefully, the rest of this damage Attack Template is self explanatory.</p>'
							+'<h2>6. Monster Attack Templates</h2>'
							+'<p>If a creature specified as a Monster on the Character Sheet uses in-hand weapons, as supported under the RPGMaster APIs, attacks with those weapons (Melee or Ranged) will use the standard <i>To Hit</i> and <i>Damage</i> Attack Templates described above.  However, attacks by creatures that are specified as Monsters (e.g. on the Monster tab of the Advanced 2nd Edition character sheet) are generally much simpler than character attacks with in-hand weapons.  The differences mean that such creatures require different Attack Templates.  Attacks specified on the Monster tab use the Monster Attack Templates: Mon-Attk, Mon-DmgSM, and Mon-DmgL (or the Targeted Attack Templates, see later).  Remember that the AttackMaster API supports an extension of the Monster Attk fields on the Advanced 2nd Edition Character Sheet: each can contain a comma-separated list consisting of "attack name","dice roll","speed in segments","damage type" (see AttackMaster Help for details).</p>'
							+'<p>The Monster Attack and Damage Templates look like this:</p>'
							+'<h4>Mon-Attk</h4>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;"><b>^^toWhoPublic^^</b> &{template:<b>^^defaultTemplate^^</b>}{{title=<b>^^tname^^</b> attacks with their <b>^^attk^^</b>}}{{subtitle=Monster Attack}}{{Weapon Used=<b>^^attk^^</b>}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[MonAttk,AttackMacro,1d20,Attack]</mark><span style="color:red">!setattr --silent --charid <b>^^cid^^</b> --ac-hit|{{AC Hit=[[</span>([[<b>^^thac0^^</b>]][Thac0]) - ([[<b>^^magicAttkAdj^^</b>]][Magic hit adj]) - ([[<b>^^toHitRoll^^</b>cs\><b>^^monsterCritHit^^</b>cf\<<b>^^monsterCritMiss^^</b>]][Dice roll]) ]]}}<span style="color:red">!!!</span>{{Attk Type=<b>^^weapType^^</b>}}{{Dmg S=[Roll](~<b>^^monsterDmgMacroSM^^</b>)}}{{Dmg L=[Roll](~<b>^^monsterDmgMacroL^^</b>)}}{{Crit Roll=<b>^^monsterCritHit^^</b>}}{{Fumble Roll=<b>^^monsterCritMiss^^</b>}}</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h4>Mon-DmgL</h4>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;"><b>^^toWhoPublic^^</b> &{template:<b>^^defaultTemplate^^</b>}{{title=<b>^^tname^^</b> does damage with their <b>^^attk^^</b>}}{{subtitle=Monster Attack}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[MonRoll,AttackMacro,1d20,Attack]</mark>{{AC Hit=[[@{<b>^^cname^^</b>|ac-hit}[AC Hit] ]]}}{{Attk Type=<b>^^weapType^^</b>}}{{Dmg L=[[(([[<b>^^monsterDmg^^</b>]][<b>^^attk^^</b> Dmg])+([[<b>^^magicDmgAdj^^</b>]][Added Magic Dmg]))]]}}{{Dmg S=[Roll](~<b>^^monsterDmgMacroSM^^</b>)}}{{Crit Roll=<b>^^monsterCritHit^^</b>}}{{Fumble Roll=<b>^^monsterCritMiss^^</b>}}</p>'
							+'<p>Unsurprisingly, these work in exactly the same way as other Attack Templates.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>7. Targeted Attack Templates</h2>'
							+'<p>The AttackMaster API supports the DM (and optionally, Players) using "targeted attacks".  This is an attack that prompts the DM / Player to select a target token, and then performs all attack and damage dice rolls at the same time, displaying the attack results alongside the Armour Class and relative health of the targeted opponent.  This speeds the attack process even further than having the API do all the attack calculations.  <b>Note:</b> the results of the attack <i>are not</i> applied to the targeted opponent - the results are still open to interpretation by the Players and DM, and circumstantial adjustment before manually applying them to the Token / Character Sheet of the opponent.</p>'
							+'<p>The Ranged weapon Targeted Attack Template for AD&D2e (for example) looks like this:</p>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;"><b>^^toWhoPublic^^</b> &{template:<b>^^defaultTemplate^^</b>}{{title=<b>^^tname^^</b> attacks @{Target|Select Target|Token_name} with their <b>^^weapon^^</b>}}{{subtitle=Ranged Attack &#42; **Ammo Left: <b>^^ammoLeft^^</b>**}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[RWtargetedAttk,AttackMacro,1d20,Attack]</mark>{{AC Hit=[[([[<b>^^thac0^^</b>]][Thac0])-(([[<b>^^weapAttkAdj^^</b>]][Weapon+]) + ([[<b>^^ammoDmgAdj^^</b>]][Ammo+]) + ([[<b>^^weapStyleAdj^^</b>]][Style+]) + ([[ <b>^^weapDexBonus^^</b>*[[<b>^^dexMissile^^</b>]]]][Dexterity+] )+([[[[<b>^^strAttkBonus^^</b>]]*[[<b>^^weapStrHit^^</b>]]]][Strength+])+([[<b>^^raceBonus^^</b>]][Race mod])+([[<b>^^profPenalty^^</b>]][Prof penalty])+([[<b>^^magicAttkAdj^^</b>]][Magic Hit+])+([[<b>^^twoWeapPenalty^^</b>]][2-weap penalty])+([[<b>^^rangeMod^^</b>]][Range mod]))-([[<b>^^toHitRoll^^</b>cs\><b>^^weapCritHit^^</b>cf\<<b>^^weapCritMiss^^</b>]][Dice roll]) ]] }}{{Attk Type=<b>^^weapType^^</b>}}{{Target AC=<b>^^targetACmissile^^</b>}}{{Target SAC=<b>^^ACvsSlashMissile^^</b>}}{{Target PAC=<b>^^ACvsPierceMissile^^</b>}}{{Target BAC=<b>^^ACvsBludgeonMissile^^</b>}}{{Dmg S=[[ floor( ([[<b>^^ammoDmgSM^^</b>]][Dice roll]) * ([[(^^rangeN^^*0.5)+(^^rangePB^^*(1+^^masterProfPB^^))+(^^rangeSMLF^^*1)]][Range mult])) + ([[<b>^^rangePB^^</b>*<b>^^masterProfPB^^</b>*2]][Range mod]) + (([[<b>^^ammoDmgAdj^^</b>]][Ammo+])+([[<b>^^ammoStyleDmgAdj^^</b>+<b>^^ammoStyleDmgSM^^</b>]][Style+])+([[<b>^^magicDmgAdj^^</b>]][Magic dmg+]) +([[<b>^^strDmgBonus^^</b>*<b>^^ammoStrDmg^^</b>]][Strength+])) ]]}}{{Dmg L=[[ floor( ([[<b>^^ammoDmgSM^^</b>]][Dice roll]) * ([[(<b>^^rangeN^^</b>*0.5)+(<b>^^rangePB^^</b>*(1+<b>^^masterProfPB^^</b>))+(<b>^^rangeSMLF^^</b>*1)]][Range mult])) + ([[<b>^^rangePB^^</b>*<b>^^masterProfPB^^</b>*2]][Range mod]) + (([[<b>^^ammoDmgAdj^^</b>]][Ammo+])+([[<b>^^ammoStyleDmgAdj^^</b>+<b>^^ammoStyleDmgL^^</b>]][Style+])+([[<b>^^magicDmgAdj^^</b>]][Magic dmg+]) +([[<b>^^strDmgBonus^^</b>*<b>^^ammoStrDmg^^</b>]][Strength+])) ]]}}{{Target HP=^<b>^targetHP^^</b>}}{{Target MaxHP=<b>^^targetMaxHP^^</b>}}{{Target Heart=<b>^^targetHP^^</b>/<b>^^targetMaxHP^^</b>}}{{Crit Roll=<b>^^weapCritHit^^</b>}}{{Fumble Roll=<b>^^weapCritMiss^^</b>}}{{Result=AC Hit\<=Target AC}}</p>'
							+'<p>The key difference, other than doing all of the calculations for the Armour Class hit and both the damage for Medium and smaller and Large and larger, is that several of the Template Fields used resolve to appropriately formatted Roll20 <i>@{target|...}</i> entries, that will display values from the targeted opponent\'s token and/or character sheet.  The API searches for the most appropriate token and character sheet fields to resolve the targeted Template Fields to (it searches the attacking creature\'s data, and assumes all tokens are set up the same way): if using the standard RPGMaster token settings (as set by the <b>CommandMaster API --abilities</b> command or [Token Setup] DM\'s Macro button) it will find the data it needs on the token; otherwise it will first search other token fields, then standard Character Sheet character tab fields, then Character Sheet monster tab fields.  If the API can\'t find AC or HP data, it will display appropriate text saying the data was not found, but will not cause an error.  Thus it is sensible to use these Template Fields rather than statically defined <i>@{target|...}</i> commands.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>8. Bespoke / Custom Attack Templates</h2>'
							+'<p>All of the above examples and discussion have explored the standard Attack Templates distributed with the AttackMaster API.  It will be the case that this will cater for around 95% of attacks and attack-like situations (e.g. there is a weapon called "Touch" which Spell Casters can use for touch-attack spells, which uses the standard Attack Templates without change to achieve the needed outcome).  However, for that other 5% (or perhaps closer to 1%) of special cases you can define your own bespoke or custom Attack Templates.  Being able to change the way attacks are calculated is also essential if you wish to adapt the API to work for game systems other than those for which RPGMaster Library rulesets currently exist.</p>'
							+'<p>As stated in Section 1, you <i>should not</i> add Attack Templates to the <i>Attacks-DB</i> database directly. Instead, create your own Character Sheet named <i>Attack-DB-[any-name-you-want]</i> and add Attack Templates to it. If you want to replace the Attack Templates provided for Melee weapons, Ranged weapons and/or Monster attacks, just create ones in your added database with the same Ability Macro name and they will automatically be used in preference to the standard versions.</p>'
							+'<p>As also mentioned previously, while Attack Templates are always called with names of the format given in Section 3, they do not have to result in standard attacks or damage - the calculations and resulting information provided to players can be whatever is needed as a result of that attack action.  An example of this is included in the distributed <i>Attacks-DB</i>, the <b>Oil Flask Attack Template set</b>:</p>'

							+'<h1>Fighting Styles Database</h1>'
							+'<h6><i>for AttackMaster v1.3.05</i> and later</h6>'
							+'<h2>1. General Database information</h2>'
							+'<p>The RPGMaster APIs use a number of databases to hold Ability Macros defining rules, conditions and benefits of various styles of fighting with weapons and shields, defined in the RPGMaster Library for various game versions. Databases supplied with the APIs are held internally to the APIs. However, the AttackMaster or MagicMaster API command <b>--extract-db</b> can be used to extract any or all standard databases to Character Sheets for examination and update. DMs can add their own fighting style definitions to additional databases held as Character Sheets. Additional databases should be named as follows:</p>'
							+'<table><tr><td>Fighting Styles:</td><td>additional databases: Styles-DB-[added name] where [added name] can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr></table>'
							+'<p><b>However:</b> the system will ignore any database with a name that includes a version number of the form "v#.#" where # can be any number or group of numbers e.g. Styles-DB v2.13 will be ignored.  This is so that the DM can version control their databases, with only the current one (without a version number) being live.</p>'
							+'<p>There can be as many additional databases as you want.  Other Master series APIs come with additional databases, some of which overlap - this does not cause a problem as version control and merging unique macros is managed by the APIs.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> all Character Sheet databases <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> have their <i>\'ControlledBy\'</i> value (found under the [Edit] button at the top right of each sheet) set to <i>\'All Players\'</i>.  This must be for all databases, both those provided (set by the API) and any user-defined ones.  Otherwise, Players will not be able to run the macros contained in them.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> databases extracted using the <b>--extract-db</b> command will be able to be edited, but will also slow the system down - the versions held internally in the APIs are much faster for the system to access. Once any extracted database has been examined, it is best to delete them and use the <b>--check-db</b> to re-index the databases so the system operates as fast as possible.</p>'
							+'<p>Each database has a similar structure, with:</p>'
							+'<ul><li>Ability Macros named as the fighting style specified, and used to describe and provide specifications for using the commands with the AttackMaster API;</li>'
							+'<li>Custom Attributes with the attribute name "ct-ability-macro-name", one per Ability Macro, which defines the speed and type for each item;</li>'
							+'<li>An entry in a list on the character sheet in the spell book of the relevant Character Sheet tab (various spell books for different items - see entry below);</li>'
							+'<li>Optionally, some entries come also with attributes that define Powers and Spells delivered by or stored on the item (irrelevant for fighting styles).</li></ul>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> a DM only needs to program the Ability Macro using the formats shown in the next section, and then run the <b>!attk --check-db</b> or <b>!magic --check-db</b> command, which will correctly parse the ability macro and set the rest of the database entries as needed.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability Macros can be whatever the DM wants and can be as simple or as complex as desired, as long as they include the required information specified below. Roll Templates are very useful when defining ability macros - the RPGMaster Library provides several new Roll Templates that do not rely on any particular Character Sheet: <i>RPGMdefault</i> is the most relevant. See the RPGMaster Library help handout for further information.  When a Player or an NPC or Monster views the specifications of a fighting style the APIs run the relevant Ability Macro from the database as if it had been run by the Player from the chat window.  All Roll20 functions for macros are available.</p>'
							+'<h3>1.1 Replacing Provided Styles</h3>'
							+'<p>If you want to replace any style provided in the databases, you can do so simply by creating an Ability Macro in one of your own databases with exactly the same name as the provided item to be replaced.  The API gives preference to Ability Macros in user-defined databases, so yours will be selected in preference to the one provided with the APIs.</p>'
							+'<h2>2. Fighting Style Databases</h2>'
							+'<p>Fighting style databases have names that start with Styles-DB, and can have anything put at the end, though those with version numbers of the form v#.# as part of the name will be ignored.</p>'
							+'<p>As previously stated, each style definition has 3 (or 4) parts in the database (see Section 1): an Ability Macro with a name that is unique and matches the style, an Attribute with the name of the Ability Macro preceded by "ct-", a listing in the database character sheet of the ability macro name separated by \'|\' along with other fighting styles. The quickest way to understand these entries is to examine existing entries.  Do extract the root databases and take a look (but remember to delete them after exploring the items in them, so as not to slow the system down unnecessarily).</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> The DM creating new weapons does not need to worry about anything other than the Ability Macro in the database, as running the <b>AttackMaster</b> or <b>MagicMaster -check-db Styles-DB</b> command will update all other aspects of the database appropriately for all databases that have a name starting with or including <i>\'Styles-DB\'</i>, as long as the <i>Specs</i> and <i>Data</i> fields are correctly defined.  Running the command <b>-check-db</b> with no parameters will check and update all databases.</p>'
							+'<p>The Styles-DB database provided with the APIs contains standard definitions for the four fighting styles defined in <i>The Complete Fighter\'s Handbook</i>, plus a couple of other examples for Ranged weapons to demonstrate how other styles can be defined.  After extracting the provided Styles database or creating your own as discussed above, aAbility macros can be added to a database just by using the [+Add] button at the top of the Abilities column in the Attributes and Abilities tab of the Database Character Sheet, and then using the edit "pencil" icon on the new entry to open it for editing.  Ability macros are standard Roll20 functionality and not dependent on the API.  Refer to the Roll20 Help Centre for more information.</p>'
							+'<p>Here is an example:</p>'
							+'<h3>Weapon & Shield Style</h3>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;">&{template:RPGMdefault}{{name=Two Weapon Fighting Style}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[Two Weapon,Style,2H,Melee-Style]</mark>{{desc=With this popular style, the fighter has a weapon in each hand—usually a longer weapon in his good hand and a shorter one in his off-hand. Unless the character has Style Specialization in this style, the second (off-hand) weapon must be shorter than the primary weapon.}}<mark style="color:blue">StyleData=[prime:melee, offhand:melee, t:any, st:any],[twp:0.2],[twp:0.2]</mark>{{desc1=**Advantages**<br>'
							+'One great advantage to this style is that you always have another weapon in hand if you drop or lose one. A single Disarm maneuver cannot rid you of your weapons.}}{{desc2=**Disadvantages**<br>'
							+'The principal disadvantage to this style, as with some other styles, is that you don\'t gain the AC benefit of a shield.}}{{desc3=**Style Specialization**<br>'
							+'Please read the "Attacking with Two Weapons" section from the Player\'s Handbook, page 96, before continuing.<br>'
							+'If you devote a weapon proficiency slot to style specialization with Two-Weapon Style, you get two important benefits. First, your attack penalty drops; before, it was a –2 with your primary weapon and –4 with your secondary, but with Specialization in Two-Weapon Style it becomes 0 with your primary weapon and a –2 with your secondary weapon. (If you\'re already ambidextrous, that penalty is 0 with primary weapon and 0 with secondary weapon). Second, you\'re allowed to use weapons of the same length in each hand, so you can, for example, wield two long swords.<br>'
							+'When fighting with two-weapon technique, you can choose for both weapons to try the same maneuver (for example, two strikes, or two disarms), or can have each try a different maneuver (one strike and one parry, one pin and one strike). If the two maneuvers are to be different, each receives a –1 attack penalty.<br>'
							+'Though rangers don\'t suffer the off-hand penalties for two-weapons use, they do not get a bonus to attack rolls if they devote a weapon proficiency slot to Two-Weapon Style. They do get the other benefit, of being able to use weapons of equal length.}}</p>'
							+'<p>The ability specification for the Weapon & Shield Fighting Style uses a Roll20 Roll Template, in this case defined in the RPGMaster Library (see the help handout for the Library to review the specifications of this template), but any Roll Template you desire can be used.  The entries in the Roll Template itself can be anything you desire, giving as much or as little information as you want.  However, the important elements for the APIs are those highlighted.  Each of these elements are inserted <i>between</i> the elements of the Roll Template, meaning they will not be seen by the player when the macro is run.  Generally spaces, hyphens and underscores in the data elements are ignored, and case is not significant.  Each element is described below:</p>'
							+'<pre>Specs = [Type, Spec Class, Handedness, Style Group]</pre>'
							+'<p>The Specs section describes what style type and proficiency groups this weapon belongs to.  These fields must be in this order.  This format is identical for all database items, whether in these databases or others used by the Master series of APIs.</p>'

							+'<p>Here is another example showing how the keys <i>oneh</i> and <i>twoh</i> are used in combination with other keys to implement the Two-Hander Style:</p>'
							+'<h3>Two-Hander Style</h3>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;">&{template:RPGMdefault}{{name=Two Hander Fighting Style}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[Two Hander,Style,2H,Melee-style]</mark>{{desc=Two-Hander Style involves carrying and wielding a weapon with both hands. Naturally, many weapons (including polearms, the great axe, the two-handed sword, and others) require two-handed technique. Other weapons (such as bastard sword, javelin, and spear) have it as a listed option.}}<mark style="color:blue">StyleData=[twohand:melee, weaps:any],[1H:dmg=+1, 2H:mwsp=-3],[1H:dmg=+1, 2H:mwsp=-3]</mark>{{desc1=**Advantages**<br>'
							+'The main advantage of two-handed weapon technique is that it allows the character to wield large two-handed weapons which can do substantial amounts of damage. <br>'
							+'A second advantage is that, if you are using a two-handed weapon, the Disarm maneuver is only of partial use against you. A single successful Disarm against a two-handed weapon user won\'t knock the weapon out of the wielder\'s hands; it will merely knock his weapon askew and make him take some time to recover, so he automatically loses initiative on his next round. However, two Disarm maneuvers successfully made against the character in the same round will knock the weapon loose.}}{{desc2=**Disadvantages**<br>'
							+'As with single-weapon use, two-handed weapon technique has the drawback that the user cannot wear or use a shield, or gain the shield\'s AC bonus.}}{{desc3=**Style Specialization**<br>'
							+'You can, by devoting a weapon proficiency to it, take a Style Specialization with Two-Hander Style.<br>'
							+'Style Specialization with Two-Hander Style gives you a very specific benefit: When you\'re using a weapon two-handed, that weapon\'s Speed Factor is reduced by 3.<br>'
							+'This is because when a fighter wields such a weapon with both hands on the hilt, he has more leverage on the blade and can move it faster. That\'s what Style Specialization in Two-Hander Style will do for the character: It teaches him how to use the weapon much faster and more aggressively than someone with less specialized training in the weapon.}}{{desc4=**One-Handed Weapons Used Two-Handed**<br>'
							+'Some players don\'t realize that many other one-handed weapons can also be used two-handed. If you specialize in Two-Hander Style and then use a one-handed weapon in two hands, you also get a bonus of +1 to damage. The one-handed weapons which can be used two-handed in this fashion include: Battle axe, Club, Footman\'s flail, Footman\'s pick, Horseman\'s flail, Horseman\'s mace, Horseman\'s pick, Morning star, Long sword, Warhammer.}}</p>'
							+'<p>Here the data specification is:</p>'
							+'<pre>StyleData=[twohand:melee, weaps:any],[1H:dmg=+1, 2H:mwsp=-3],[1H:dmg=+1, 2H:mwsp=-3]</pre>'
							+'<p>This specifies that there must be a melee weapon equipped in the [Both Hands] slot, and if this is a two-handed weapon then the melee weapon speed is improved by 3 segments.  However, if the weapon in the [Both Hands] slot is one of the few one-handed weapons allowed to be taken in both hands (as defined in The Complete Fighter\'s Handbook for this style), then instead it will gain +1 to the damage it inflicts. In this case, the same benefits apply whether the character is just proficient or specialist in the Two-Hander Style.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> only cetain one-handed weapons can be taken in both hands. Indeed, only certain one-handd weapons will appear in the weapon list shown when the [Both Hands] button is selected on the <i>Change Weapon</i> menu. This is achieved in the weapon specifications in the Weapons Database. For full details, see the explanation given in the <i>Weapons & Armour Database Help</i> handout. In summary, a one-handed weapon which can be wielded two-handed and gain Two-Hander Fighting Style benefits, such as a Battle Axe, requires a second <i>Specs</i> dataset with the \'2H\' attribute, but <b><i>no additional ToHitData datasets.</i></b>  This informs the APIs that this weapon can be taken in both hands, but will not gain any benefits from doing so (unlike, e.g. a Bastard Sword) unless the Character has proficiency in the Two-Hander Fighting Style.</p>'
							+'<p>Other styles can be defined that are not specified in <i>The Complete Fighter\'s Handbook</i>, and some examples are provided in the distributed database:</p>'
							+'<h3>Bowyer Style</h3>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;">&{template:RPGMdefault}{{name=Bowyer Fighting Style}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[Bowyer,Style,2H,Ranged-style]</mark>{{desc=Bowyer Fighting Style reflects fighters who practice day in, day out at the range perfecting their use of bows of all types.}}<mark style="color:blue">StyleData=[twohand:ranged, weaps:bow],[rwr:+1/+1/+2/+3,rwsp:-2],[rwr:+1/+1/+3/+5,rwsp:-3,rwn:+1/2]</mark>{{desc1=**Advantages**<br>'
							+'The main advantage of bowyer technique is that it allows the character to wield two-handed bows which can do damage at long ranges, staying out of melee and making you a difficult enemy to attack.}}{{desc2=**Disadvantages**<br>'
							+'As with any two-handed weapon use use, bowyer weapon technique has the drawback that the user cannot wear or use a shield, or gain the shield\'s AC bonus.}}{{desc3=**Style Specialization**<br>'
							+'You can, by devoting a weapon proficiency to it, take a Style Specialization with Bowyer Style.<br>'
							+'Style Specialization with Bowyer Style enables you to extend your accuracy at range by 10 yards at short range, 20 at medium and 30 at long range, and improve the speed of the bow by 2 segments. As their skill improves further (by dedicating two proficiency slots), range increases further (by 30 yards at medium and 50 at long), and nocking arrows and drawing the bow faster to enable them to get additional attack every other round}}</p>'
							+'<p>This style has a slightly more complex data specification:</p>'
							+'<pre>StyleData=[twohand:ranged, weaps:bow],[rwr:+1/+1/+2/+3,rwsp:-2],[rwr:+1/+1/+3/+5,rwsp:-3,rwn:+1/2]</pre>'
							+'<p>You can see here the application of the restriction of this fighting style to two-handed ranged weapons that belong to the weapon group <i>bow</i>, then applying benefits using the range extension key <i>rwr</i>, the ranged weapon speed modifier <i>rwsp</i>, and improving the number of attacks for a ranged weapon by one attack per two rounds using <i>rwn</i>.</p>'
							+'<p>A wide range of fighting styles can be created using the different combination of rules and benefits, to enrich the game you create, and your players experience.  If you need help or guidance, or experience any issues, do access the RPGMaster forum on Roll20 - search the wiki for the link, or navigate via the Community Forums to the API / Mods forum and search for RPGMaster.</p>'
