    "description": "RPGMaster Library for AD&D2e provides all of the game-version-specific data and rule processing for the RPGMaster series of APIs to work with the Advanced Dungeon & Dragons 2nd Edition rule set, and with the Advanced D&D2e Character Sheet by Peter B.  Other versions of the library will support other gave versions in future. In order for versions of the RPGMaster series APIs later than 1.0.0 to work (i.e. those that have version numbers with three segments) they require one of the RPGMaster Libraries to be loaded with them: which one determines which rule set and character sheet they work with. The Library does not support any API commands itself (the other RPGMaster APIs provide those), but it supports a unique set of Roll Templates, and provides API Authors with a number of callable functions that might be of use. See the RPGMaster Library Help handout that the Library creates in your campaign when initially loaded for details.\n\n[RPGMaster Documentation](https://wiki.roll20.net/RPGMaster) \n### Getting Started\n1. When all APIs in the RPGMaster suite are loaded, run `!cmd --initialise` and add the player macros created to the Macro Bar, then\n2. Select tokens and use the `Token Setup` macro bar button just created to add all relevant Action Buttons to the token(s) (plus set the tokens/Characters up in any other way provided in the menu displayed) \n3. Once steps 1 & 2 have been done, the players and DM can then use the buttons displayed at the top of the screen when their character's token is selected to perform all actions needed in normal play.",
