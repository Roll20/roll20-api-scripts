    "description": "RPGMaster Library for AD&D2e provides all of the game-version-specific data and rule processing for the RPGMaster series of APIs to work with the Advanced Dungeon & Dragons 2nd Edition rule set, and with the Advanced D&D2e Character Sheet by Peter B.  Other versions of the library will support other gave versions in future. In order for versions of the RPGMaster series APIs later than 1.0.0 to work (i.e. those that have version numbers with three segments) they require one of the RPGMaster Libraries to be loaded with them: which one determines with rule set and character sheet they work with. The Library does not support any API commands itself (the other RPGMaster APIs provide those), but it supports a unique set of Roll Templates, and provides API Authors with a number of callable functions that might be of use. See the RPGMaster Library Help handout that the Library creates in your campaign when initially loaded for details.",
