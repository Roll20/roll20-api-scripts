DynamicLightHelper automatically splits lines drawn on the Dynamic Lighting layer and adds control points for easy manipulation.

## Commands

```!Dynamic_Light_Helper [hidehelp|showhelp]```

When DynamicLightHelper starts up, it will whisper command buttons to the gm to allow them to toggle help on and off.

DynamicLightHelper works on square grids.  You can toggle it on and off by setting the `Show Labels (hex only)` setting in the **Page Settings** dialog.
