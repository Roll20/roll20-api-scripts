# It's A Trap! - World of Darkness (classic) theme

This script is a trap theme supplement for the It's a Trap! script designed to
support World of Darkness (classic) character sheets.

Currently this script provides automatic support for the following sheets:
Changeling: The Dreaming, Demon: The Fallen, Mage: The Ascension, Vampire: The Dark Ages, Vampire: The Masquerade, Werewolf: The Apocalypse, and all the forementioned's 20th anniversary edition variations.

Other sheets, custom sheets, and characters based upon plain attributes are also supported.
For those, just fill in the names for the character attributes in the user options for
this script.

## Theme-specific properties
The following trap properties are specific to this trap theme script.

### Attack Dice
The number of dice rolled in the trap's attack.

### Damage Dice
The number of dice rolled for the trap's pre-SOAK damage.

### Passive Perception
The number of successes a character must get in a Perception + Alertness roll
to passively notice a trap. This is rolled automatically the first time a
character comes within search range for the trap.

## Help

Due to complications with the API reading attributes from certain character sheets,
there have been issues in the past with things such as saving throws or passive perception
not being correct. If this happens, first try adjusting the values for these on
your character sheet or try re-creating the character sheet from scratch to see
if that resolves the problem.

If you continue to experience any issues while using this script,
need help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature, please reply to this thread:
