	"description": "## Condefinition\r### What it does\r\rCondefinition reads incoming roll templates and looks for imposed conditions and saving throws. It displays button(s) in chat that allow you to:\r- Quickly apply a corresponding token marker\r- Define the condition\r- Track concentration\r- Roll saving throws\r- Apply damage from spells or effects triggered by saving throws\r- If the roll template contains a saving throw, it gives a button for the saving throw. Press the button and click on a target to roll the appropriate save. With **GroupCheck** installed, it runs a groupcheck save. If you have [**Apply Damage**](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/3631602/script-groupcheck-roll-checks-saves-et-cetera-for-many-tokens-at-once/?pageforid=4359153#post-4359153) installed, it also applies damage.\r- If the roll template contains an imposed condition, it creates a button to define the condition. If there's a cross-reference in the definition, it creates an inline link. You can hover or whisper/broadcast the text to players.\r- You can toggle that condition on selected tokens. Assigning token markers requires **TokenMod**, and for improved function, **LibTokenMarkers**. Default status markers are included, and the configuration handout allows you to customize these.\r- If installed via One-Click, this Mod will also auto-install **GroupCheck**, **TokenMod**, and **LibTokenMarkers** if theyâ€™re missing. **[Apply Damage](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/3631602/script-groupcheck-roll-checks-saves-et-cetera-for-many-tokens-at-once/?pageforid=4359153#post-4359153)** must be installed manually.\r- In addition to official conditions, it tracks many common features that benefit from markers (e.g., Raging, Hunter's Mark, Hexblade's Curse).\r- The Concentration condition marker also tracks concentration and prompts for a Constitution Save when damaged.\r- Compatible with Classic and Jumpgate VTT, and the 2014 or 2024 D&D sheets. Advanced configuration requires JavaScript knowledge.\r### What it can't do\r\rThere are some limitations:\r- Primarily designed for GMs and NPCs. Players may see buttons, but full use is GM-facing.\r- Conditions are matched to tokens, not character sheets (intentional, for individual instances like multiple goblins).\r- Some condition wordings may be missed, especially in non-WotC content.\r- Currently, all buttons and definitions are whispered to the controller of the NPC. If needed, this could change based on whisper settings.\r### Helper Scripts\r- **Required:** `TokenMod`, `libTokenMarkers`\r- **Optional/Recommended:** `GroupCheck`, [`Apply Damage`](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/3631602/script-groupcheck-roll-checks-saves-et-cetera-for-many-tokens-at-once/?pageforid=4359153#post-4359153)\r---\r## Operation\rFor full documentation and configuration options, enter `!config-help` or `!condef-config` in chat. The script produces a full documentation handout.",
