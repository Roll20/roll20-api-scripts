It displays button(s) in chat that allow you to:\r- Quickly apply a corresponding token marker\r- Define the condition\r- Track concentration\r- Roll saving throws\r- Apply damage from spells or effects triggered by saving throws\r- If the roll template contains a saving throw, it gives a button for the saving throw. Press the button and click on a target to roll the appropriate save. With **GroupCheck** installed, it runs a groupcheck save. If you have [**Apply Damage**](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/3631602/script-groupcheck-roll-checks-saves-et-cetera-for-many-tokens-at-once/?pageforid=4359153#post-4359153) installed, it also applies damage.\r- If the roll template contains an imposed condition, it creates a button to define the condition. If there's a cross-reference in the definition, it creates an inline link. You can hover or whisper/broadcast the text to players.\r- You can toggle that condition on selected tokens. Assigning token markers requires **TokenMod**, and for improved function, **LibTokenMarkers**. Default status markers are included, and the configuration handout allows you to customize these.\r- If installed via One-Click, this Mod will also auto-install **GroupCheck**, **TokenMod**, and **LibTokenMarkers** if they’re missing. **[Apply Damage](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/3631602/script-groupcheck-roll-checks-saves-et-cetera-for-many-tokens-at-once/?pageforid=4359153#post-4359153)** must be installed manually.\r- In addition to official conditions, it tracks many common features that benefit from markers (e.g., Raging, Hunter's Mark, Hexblade's Curse).\r- The Concentration condition marker also tracks concentration and prompts for a Constitution Save when damaged.\r- Compatible with Classic and Jumpgate VTT, and the 2014 or 2024 D&D sheets. Advanced configuration requires JavaScript knowledge.\r### What it can't do\r\rThere are some limitations:\r- Primarily designed for GMs and NPCs. Players may see buttons, but full use is GM-facing.\r- Conditions are matched to tokens, not character sheets (intentional, for individual instances like multiple goblins).\r- Some condition wordings may be missed, especially in non-WotC content.\r- Currently, all buttons and definitions are whispered to the controller of the NPC. If needed, this could change based on whisper settings.\r### Helper Scripts\r- **Required:** `TokenMod`, `libTokenMarkers`\r- **Optional/Recommended:** `GroupCheck`, [`Apply Damage`](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/3631602/script-groupcheck-roll-checks-saves-et-cetera-for-many-tokens-at-once/?pageforid=4359153#post-4359153)\r---\r## Operation\r### **Buttons**\r\rWhenever a condition is implied in chat, or the report function is used on a token, a button is created. Each button has three parts:\r- **Middle:** Sends the condition definition to the GM. Some include cross-links to related conditions (e.g., *Unconscious* also includes *Incapacitated*).\r- **Left side:** Word balloon icon that sends the condition to all players.\r- **Right side:** Toggles the token marker for selected tokens.\r![Condition Button Example](https://files.d20.io/images/442935594/yOS7eoRAux8WyT5rvSFaLg/original.png?1748567284)\r---\r### **List All Common Condition Definitions**\r\rType `!condef-all` in chat to display all official condition buttons. This does not include extras like *Raging* or *Marked*, just the official conditions.\r![All Conditions Screenshot](https://files.d20.io/images/442933995/z7UHtU9JRZgfR0p0vx_H4g/original.png?1748566537)\r---\r### **Concentration**\r\rWhen a token takes damage and has a concentration marker, Condefinition calculates and prompts a Constitution Save.\r\rExample: "Morrigan" takes 30 damage while concentrating. The script detects the marker and produces a save button.\r\rNote: This requires **GroupCheck** configured for both 2014 and 2024 sheets.\r![Concentration Save Screenshot](https://files.d20.io/images/442936255/oTJKREx0B8Dwp5TQ6VGxyg/original.png?1748567553)\r---\r### **Report**\r\rSelect tokens and run `!condef-report`. The script creates condition buttons for each token with active markers. These buttons only affect the associated token.\r![Report Screenshot](https://files.d20.io/images/442937172/myYkaSLzPA8hqYG9xKlu_g/original.png?1748568068)\r---\r### **Automation of Abilities that Force Saving Throws**\r\rRequires both **GroupCheck** and manually installed [`Apply Damage`](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/3631602/script-groupcheck-roll-checks-saves-et-cetera-for-many-tokens-at-once/?pageforid=4359153#post-4359153). The spell or ability must be sent to chat with its Description turned on to trigger automation.\r![Apply Damage Automation](https://files.d20.io/images/442940114/kWl_PCGDYV8f_9cs_jw_Yw/original.png?1748569736)\r\rThe button works like the concentration check: left half rolls saves for all selected tokens, and optionally applies damage.\r![Save and Apply Damage Button](https://files.d20.io/images/442941123/VzdgD5qvSLHRqwKBX2rXNw/original.png?1748570402)\r---\r## Configuration\r\rSupports conditions from both 2014 and 2024 rule sets. Can switch between default token markers or the author's "Easy to Read" marketplace markers.\r### The Condefinitions Handout\r\rUse `!condef help` or `!condef config` to access settings.\r\rCondition definitions are stored in a handout named **Condefinitions** and consist of 4-line entries separated by an empty line:\r\r1. **Line 1:** Condition name  \r2. **Line 2:** Regex to match keywords (e.g., "poisoned|toxic")  \r3. **Line 3:** One-line definition (can include simple HTML)  \r4. **Line 4:** Name of the token marker\r\rTo update, save the handout and click **Update Conditions** in chat. Use the **Code** style when pasting definitions.\r**Tip:** Duplicate the handout before editing, in case you need to roll back.\r\rIf you use a custom marketplace set for token markers, feel free to share your config — just ensure clean, plain text and wrap in the `Code` style.\r![Configuration Screenshot](https://files.d20.io/images/442943259/dwGOgHA6nb3a8fRJIat8Dw/original.png?1748571846)",
