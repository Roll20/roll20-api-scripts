    "description": "RoundMaster is an API for the Roll20 RPG-DS.  Its purpose is to extend the functionality of the Turn Tracker capability already built in to Roll20.  It is one of several other similar APIs available on the platform that support the Turn Tracker and manage token and character statuses related to the passing of time: the USP of this one is the full richness of its functionality including token status effect macros that make real things happen.[RoundMaster Documentation](https://wiki.roll20.net/Script:RoundMaster) \n\n### Related APIs\nThis API works best with the RPGMaster series of APIs, and most especially the InitMaster API\n[RPGMaster Documentation](https://wiki.roll20.net/RPGMaster)\n[InitMaster Documentation](https://wiki.roll20.net/Script:InitMaster) \n\n### If using with InitMaster\n* As a Macro in the DM's macro quick bar, add the command `!init --maint` to manage RoundMaster functions\n* Add the command `!init --menu` as an Ability Macros on Character Sheets of Characters, NPCs & Monsters that will use the API, and tick 'Show as Token Action'.  These menus will then be available to Players controlling those sheets and give access to all common commands used in game-play.\n\n### Further Information\nRoundMaster is based on the much older TrackerJacker API, and many thanks to Ken L. for creating TrackerJacker.  However, RoundMaster is a considerable fix and extension to TrackerJacker, suited to many different applications in many different RPG scenarios.  On loading, RoundMaster will create handouts in the Campaign with help on all its commands and functions.  It will also create a Character Sheet database of Effect macros - see the documentation in the handouts for more information.",
