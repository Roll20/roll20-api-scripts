# It's A Trap! - D&D 4th Edition

This is a trap theme to support the D&D 4th Edition character sheet by
Alex L., Ville S., and Wesley L..

## Theme-specific properties
The following trap properties are specific to this trap theme script.

### Attack Bonus
The modifier for the trap's attack roll, if it makes an attack roll.

### Damage
A dice expression for the damage dealt by the trap on a hit. This does not
take any damage resistances or immunities into account.

### Defense
This property specifies whether the trap's attack roll is against its victim's
AC, Fortitude, Reflex, or Will.

### Miss - Half Damage
This property specifies whether victims of the trap will still take half damage,
even if they avoided the trap. This does not take into account any special
abilities such as Evasion.

### Saving Throw
If the trap allows a saving throw, choose which saving throw it uses with this
property.

### Saving Throw DC
This property specifies the DC for the above saving throw.

### Spot DC
This property specifies the passive Perception needed for a character to
passively spot the trap.

## Help

Due to complications with the API reading attributes from certain character sheets,
there have been issues in the past with things such as saving throws or passive perception
not being correct. If this happens, first try adjusting the values for these on
your character sheet or try re-creating the character sheet from scratch to see
if that resolves the problem.

If you continue to experience any issues while using this script,
need help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature, please reply to this thread:
