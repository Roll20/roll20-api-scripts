# FATE Point Display

## What is it?

This script automatically adds and updates token markers to track characters' FATE Point totals, and provides helper macros to increment, decrement, and reset those values.


## Automatic token markers

If the user option 'Token Marker Name' is set, then the script will automatically add a numbered marker to every token in the campaign that represents a Character. This token marker will automatically update with the correct value as it is changed.

Specifically, it updates:

* When a ``!fatepointdisplay`` command is run.
* When the api is first loaded (``on("ready",...``).
* When the Fate point total on a character sheet is updated.
* When the attributes for the enable/disable marker flags oon a character sheet are update.
* When the GM moves the players to a new page.

If you need to update the token markers outside of the events above, GMs can use the ``!fatepointdisplay update`` command.

## Modify FATE Point totals

I the user option 'Use Macros'  is enabled, then it also gives you commands and macros to increment, decrement, and reset a character or characters Fate Point totals. Resetting observes the FATE rules (based on refresh).

* ``!fatepointdisplay add`` adds one fate point to each of the selected character's. Maximum of 9.
* ``!fatepointdisplay remove`` removes one fate point from each of the selected character's. Minimum of 0.
* ``!fatepointdisplay reset`` resets the selected character/s fate point totals to their refresh or current value, whichever is greater.
* ``!fatepointdisplay resetall`` resets the current fate point total of all characters in the campaign.

## User Options

The following options **must** be configured to match your character sheet. By default they are set to the value used by Evil Hats' official Roll20 FATE Character Sheet (https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/Fate).

* _Fate Point Attribute Name_: The name of the attribute representing a character's current Fate Point total.
* _Refresh Attribute Name_: The name of the attribute representing a character's Refresh.

These options can be configured to your liking:

* _Use Macros_: (Default On) If enabled then macros will automatically be created an maintained, one for each of the four commands above. ``add``, ``remove``, and ``reset`` are token macros.
* _GM Only_: (Default On) If enabled then only the GM can use the ``!fatepointdisplay`` commands.
* _Players Can Reset_: (Default off) If enabled then players can use the ``reset`` and ``resetall`` commands. Overridden by _GM Only_ setting.
* _Token Marker Name_: (Default blank) If not blank then the specified marker will be used to indicate the current fate point total on character-linked tokens. Supports custom markers. If multiple tokens with the same name exist, the first returned will be used.

In case you don't want every Character in your campaign to have the marker token, you can use the settings below to enable or disable it for specific characters. You will need to add the specified attribute to each character manually (assuming the sheet does not automatically set it).

* _Disable Marker Display Attribute Name_: (Default blank) If set, then any Character with the specified attribute with a value of '1' will not display marker tokens. NOTE: Any flagged characters will have the FATE Point token marker removed from them automatically.
* _Enable Marker Display Attribute Name_: (Default blank) If set, then only Characters with the specified attribute with a value of '1' will display marker tokens. NOTE: Any unflagged characters will have the FATE Point token marker removed from them automatically.
