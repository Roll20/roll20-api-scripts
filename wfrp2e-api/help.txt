Once installed, the script may be edited to suit your game.

Critical Success and Failure options for Combat, Parries, and Skils are currently set to 1 and 96, respectively. Set each to '0' or '101' as shown below (and helpfully commented) to disable, or adjust to your specific game style!

```
var critSucCombat = 1; //set to 0 to turn off crit success
var critFailCombat = 96; //set to 101 to turn off crit failure

...
var critSucParry = 1; //set to 0 to turn off crit success
var critFailParry = 96; //set to 101 to turn off crit failure

...

var critSucSkill = 1; //set to 0 to turn off crit success
var critFailSkill = 96; //set to 101 to turn off crit failure
```
