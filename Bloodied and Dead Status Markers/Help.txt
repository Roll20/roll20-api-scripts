Bloodied and Dead Status Markers (Contributed by Ken Bauer)
This script automatically adds the Red marker to represent the "bloodied" state for any tokens that drop below half their health, and the "dead" marker for any that drop to 0 or less. It's assumed that health is stored in Bar 1. The bar that is read can be changed by using the command !ChangeBar ****. The value can be bar1, bar2, or bar3.
