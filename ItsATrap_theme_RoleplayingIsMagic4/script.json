    "description": "# It's A Trap! - Roleplaying is Magic 4E theme\r\rThis is a My Little Pony: Roleplaying is Magic 4th edition theme for the It's A Trap! script,\rbuilt for use with the Roleplaying is Magic 4E character sheet.\r\r## Theme-specific properties\rThe following trap properties are specific to this trap theme script.\r\r### Damage\rA dice roll expression for the trap's damage.\r\r### Miss - Half Damage\rThis property specifies whether the trap still deals half damage, even on a miss.\r\r### Skill Check\rThis property specifies the skill roll needed to avoid the trap.\r\rThe first prompt asks for the name of the skill.\r\rThe second prompt asks for the primary attribute the skill is based on.\r\rThe third prompt asks for the skill check's difficulty.\r\r### Spot DC\rThis property specifies the Perception skill check difficulty for\rpassively noticing the trap.\r\r### Note about passive Perception\r\rThe Roleplaying is Magic 4E system doesn't actually have any defined rolls for\rpassive skill checks. For the purpose of this script, a character's passive Perception is\rcalculated as follows:\r\r```\r4 + (total Advantage/Disadvantage modifier) + Mind + (3 if trained) + (2 if improved) + (1 if greater) + (total Misc modifiers)\r```\r\rSo for example, a character not trained in Perception with a Mind of 2 would\rhave a passive Perception of 6. A character trained in Perception with a Mind\rof 4 would have a passive Perception of 11.\r\r## Help\r\rDue to complications with the API reading attributes from certain character sheets,\rthere have been issues in the past with things such as saving throws or passive perception\rnot being correct. If this happens, first try adjusting the values for these on\ryour character sheet or try re-creating the character sheet from scratch to see\rif that resolves the problem.\r\rIf you continue to experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature, please reply to this thread:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/forum/post/3280344/script-its-a-trap-v2-dot-3\ror shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/stephen-l\r\r## Show Support\r\rIf you would like to show your appreciation and support for the work I do in writing,\rupdating, and maintaining my API scripts, consider buying one of my art packs from the Roll20 marketplace (https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/search/?keywords=&sortby=newest&type=all&genre=all&author=Stephen%20Lindberg)\ror, simply leave a thank you note in the script's thread on the Roll20 forums.\rEither is greatly appreciated! Happy gaming!\r",
