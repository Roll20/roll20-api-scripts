# It's A Trap! - Roleplaying is Magic 4E theme

This is a My Little Pony: Roleplaying is Magic 4th edition theme for the It's A Trap! script,
built for use with the Roleplaying is Magic 4E character sheet.

### Note about passive Perception

The Roleplaying is Magic 4E system doesn't actually have any defined rolls for
passive skill checks. For the purpose of this script, a character's passive Perception is
calculated as follows:

```
4 + (total Advantage/Disadvantage modifier) + Mind + (3 if trained) + (2 if improved) + (1 if greater) + (total Misc modifiers)
```

So for example, a character not trained in Perception with a Mind of 2 would
have a passive Perception of 6. A character trained in Perception with a Mind
of 4 would have a passive Perception of 11.

## Help

Due to complications with the API reading attributes from certain character sheets,
there have been issues in the past with things such as saving throws or passive perception
not being correct. If this happens, first try adjusting the values for these on
your character sheet or try re-creating the character sheet from scratch to see
if that resolves the problem.

If you continue to experience any issues while using this script,
need help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature, please reply to this thread:
