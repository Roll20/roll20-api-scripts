# It's A Trap! - Roleplaying is Magic 4E theme

_3.1 updates:_
* Just bug fixes.

_v3.0 updates:_
* Updated the trap theme to be compatible with It's A Trap v3.0.

This is a My Little Pony: Roleplaying is Magic 4th edition theme for the It's A Trap! script,
built for use with the Roleplaying is Magic 4E character sheet.

To use this theme for the It's A Trap! script, enter 'MLP-RIM-4' for the ```theme``` user option.

### Note about passive Perception

The Roleplaying is Magic 4E system doesn't actually have any defined rolls for
passive skill checks. For the purpose of this script, a character's passive Perception is
calculated as follows:

```
4 + (total Advantage/Disadvantage modifier) + Mind + (3 if trained) + (2 if improved) + (1 if greater) + (total Misc modifiers)
```

So for example, a character not trained in Perception with a Mind of 2 would
have a passive Perception of 6. A character trained in Perception with a Mind
of 4 would have a passive Perception of 11.
