  "description": "isBeacon provides a single point for detecting which sheet a character is using. The script exposes a single function (named <code>isBeacon()</code>) and allows a scripter to pass a sheet name, a character name, a character ID, or the token ID of a token which represents a character. The function returns <code>true</code> if the associated sheet is a Beacon sheet, or <code>false</code> if it is legacy. This is for use by scripters as a tool they can leverage to include with their own scripts as a dependency.",
