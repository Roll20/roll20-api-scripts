# Marching Order

_v3.0 Updates_
* The script has been reworked entirely. Marching orders now work based upon formations formed when you tell a group of tokens to follow a leader.
* You can now save multiple formations and load them up to be used later.

This script allows you to select tokens and tell them to follow each other
in some specified marching order. Marching orders are defined by formations,
where there is a leader token and one or more follower tokens. When you set
tokens to follow a leader, it will record their position relative to the
leader in that formation, and they'll maintain that position as the leader
moves. This formation is maintained even when the leader travels around corners.

## But I liked the old version of this script!

You can still use the old version of this script by reverting back to
version 2.4. However, do so with the understanding that I won't be providing
any further technical support on versions prior to 3.0.
