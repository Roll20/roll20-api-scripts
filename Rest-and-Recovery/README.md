# Rest and Recovery
A Roll20 API script to handle recovery on the resource attributes on the D&D 5th Edition by Roll20 sheet.
To use this script, resources must include a code in their name, separated from the name by a plus sign. You can include standard dice expressions as well. "1d6" is used in all examples, but you can do 2d6+3, 3d20, etc. Here are examples of the commands given and the codes that are affected.

## !r-short
*Used for Short Rest*

**+SR** This resource will return to its maximumm value

**+SR1d6** This resource will add 1d6 to the resource up to its maximum value


## !r-long
*Used for Long Rest*

**+LR** This resource will return to its maximumm value

**+LR1d6** This resource will add 1d6 to the resource up to its maximum value


## !r-charges
*used for restoring charges that are user-controlled, such as "at dawn" or "under a full moon".

**+1d6**


## !r-ammo
no code is used here. The script looks for common ammo types: Crossbow bolts, Arrows, Bullets, etc. It rolls 1d2 for each piece of ammo expended. If the result is a "2", the ammo is recovered. The max and current values are adjusted to reflect the new total.

## !r-help
This will display the basic help syntax in chat.

## !r-list
This will list every resource that can be recovered without using a code. The script will recognize by name almost every recoverable class resource from an official sourcebook with the exception of ties such as Ravnica or Acquisitions, Inc.
