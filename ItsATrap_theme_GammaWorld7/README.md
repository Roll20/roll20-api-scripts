# It's A Trap! - Gamma World 7E theme

This is a trap theme to support the Gamma World 7E character sheet.

## Help

Due to complications with the API reading attributes from certain character sheets,
there have been issues in the past with things such as saving throws or passive perception
not being correct. If this happens, first try adjusting the values for these on
your character sheet or try re-creating the character sheet from scratch to see
if that resolves the problem.

If you continue to experience any issues while using this script,
need help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature, please reply to this thread:
