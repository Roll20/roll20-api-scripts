Things to add/fix  
  
  
**Bugs:**  
  
  
  
**New Features:**  
* Add "Next Up" on the Turn Notification
* Add a jukebox file to play/stop automatically when the initiative tracker starts/pauses/stops.  Also figure out how to actually do that.
* Player (non-DM) level favorites, perhaps a flag on current favorites to flag them as 'public'.  This would make it easier for players to use the effects, a bonus for DMs with a rotating player base especially.
* Create Favs categories???  
  * create categories (hard coded?)
  * assign categories via changefav and addfav
  * list favorites categories (listfavcats?)
  * list favorites BY category (listfavbycat?)
* Link conditions to a parent condition on another token (specifically for things like "blessed" linked to "concentration" and the like)  
* Add clickable on Turn Notification marker list to remove each marker.  Perhaps where the duration is currently displayed and bump duration to the left a little.  


**Feature Requests**
* Create functionality to use a command `!tj -menu` that returns a whispered message with buttons for the various functions (start/pause, list favs, add fav, etc)
