    "description": "# It's A Trap! - 5th Edition (Community) theme (Deprecated)\r\rThis is a D&D 5th edition trap theme for the It's A Trap! script, compatible with\rthe 5th Edition (Community) character sheet by John Myles (Actoba).\r\rThis trap theme is deprecated and planned for removal from the Roll20 API when\rthe next version of It's A Trap! is released. Please use the 5E Generic Trap Theme instead.\r\r## Help\r\rDue to complications with the API reading attributes from certain character sheets,\rthere have been issues in the past with things such as saving throws or passive perception\rnot being correct. If this happens, first try adjusting the values for these on\ryour character sheet or try re-creating the character sheet from scratch to see\rif that resolves the problem.\r\rIf you continue to experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature, please reply to this thread:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/forum/post/3280344/script-its-a-trap-v2-dot-3\ror shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/stephen-l\r\r## Show Support\r\rIf you would like to show your appreciation and support for the work I do in writing,\rupdating, and maintaining my API scripts, consider buying one of my art packs from the Roll20 marketplace (https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/search/?keywords=&sortby=newest&type=all&genre=all&author=Stephen%20Lindberg)\ror, simply leave a thank you note in the script's thread on the Roll20 forums.\rEither is greatly appreciated! Happy gaming!\r",
