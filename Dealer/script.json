After the action word, type an integer, after a space:\r\r`!deal --give 5 --Playing Cards`\r\rThe script will deal cards to the player from the specified deck so long as there are enough available. If the deck has cycled through all cards, it will automatically shuffle.\r\rIf a token has more than one controller or is controlled by All and one or more players, it will select the first single player in the controlled by list.\r\rScript will try to let you know if you have not prepared a command or deck properly.\r\rIf deck does not deal a card, you may need to manually shuffle (Roll20 bug). If the deck is shuffled, it may not recognize all cards in hand.",
