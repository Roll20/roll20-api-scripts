    "description": "A script to automatically resize a Rollable Table Token when a different side is chosen. It does this by repurposing the “weight” attribute of the Items in the Rollable Table. It was written with D&D Druid Wild Shape tokens in mind, but would work for any square rollable table tokens from which players will choose different sides.\nThe script listens to token:change events, looks for a table with the same name as the token, and updates the token size when the side changes, so no other configuration should be required.",
