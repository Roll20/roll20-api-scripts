# It's A Trap! - D&D 5E Generic

_v3.0.1 Updates:_
* Fixed One-Click options accessor.

This is a trap theme to support any campaign using D&D 5th Edition rules. To
use this, you will need to enter in the names of some character attributes into
the script's One-Click options as they appear in the character sheet data or
attributes/abilities tab. These attribute names include:
* AC
* Strength save modifier
* Dexterity save modifier
* Constitution save modifier
* Intelligence save modifier
* Wisdom save modifier
* Charisma save modifier
* Perception Modifier
* Passive Perception (If it is available on the sheet you are using)

## Theme-specific properties
The following trap properties are specific to this trap theme script.

### Attack Bonus
The modifier for the trap's attack roll, if it makes an attack roll.

### Damage
A dice expression for the damage dealt by the trap on a hit. This does not
take any damage resistances or immunities into account.

### Hide Save Result
This property specifies whether the result of the trap's saving throws will be
hidden from the players.

### Miss - Half Damage
This property specifies whether victims of the trap will still take half damage,
even if they avoided the trap. This does not take into account any special
abilities such as Evasion.

### Saving Throw
If the trap allows a saving throw, choose which saving throw it uses with this
property.

### Saving Throw DC
This property specifies the DC for the above saving throw.

### Spot DC
This property specifies the passive Perception score needed for a character to
passively spot the trap.

## Help

Due to complications with the API reading attributes from certain character sheets,
there have been issues in the past with things such as saving throws or passive perception
not being correct. If this happens, first try adjusting the values for these on
your character sheet or try re-creating the character sheet from scratch to see
if that resolves the problem.
