# It's A Trap! - D&D 5E Generic

This is a trap theme to support any campaign using D&D 5th Edition rules. To
use this, you will need to enter in the names of some character attributes into
the script's One-Click options as they appear in the character sheet data or
attributes/abilities tab. These attribute names include:
* AC
* Strength save modifier
* Dexterity save modifier
* Constitution save modifier
* Intelligence save modifier
* Wisdom save modifier
* Charisma save modifier
* Perception Modifier
* Passive Perception (If it is available on the sheet you are using)

## Help

Due to complications with the API reading attributes from certain character sheets,
there have been issues in the past with things such as saving throws or passive perception
not being correct. If this happens, first try adjusting the values for these on
your character sheet or try re-creating the character sheet from scratch to see
if that resolves the problem.

If you continue to experience any issues while using this script,
need help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature, please reply to this thread:
