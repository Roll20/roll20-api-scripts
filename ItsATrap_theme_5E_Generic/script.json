    "description": "# It's A Trap! - D&D 5E Generic\r\r_v3.1 Updates:_\r\r* Changed name of _ogl_ sheet to _roll20_.\r* Condensed saving throw properties into a single 'Saving Throw' property\r\rThis is a trap theme to support any campaign using D&D 5th Edition rules. To\ruse this, you will need to enter in the names of some character attributes into\rthe script's One-Click options as they appear in the character sheet data or\rattributes/abilities tab. These attribute names include:\r\r* AC\r* Strength save modifier\r* Dexterity save modifier\r* Constitution save modifier\r* Intelligence save modifier\r* Wisdom save modifier\r* Charisma save modifier\r* Perception Modifier\r* Passive Perception (If it is available on the sheet you are using)\r\r## Theme-specific properties\rThe following trap properties are specific to this trap theme script.\r\r### Attack Bonus\rThe modifier for the trap's attack roll, if it makes an attack roll.\r\r### Damage\rA dice expression for the damage dealt by the trap on a hit. This does not\rtake any damage resistances or immunities into account. Neither does it\ractually subtract the hit points. You'll have to do that manually.\r\r### Miss - Half Damage\rThis property specifies whether victims of the trap will still take half damage,\reven if they avoided the trap. This does not take into account any special\rabilities such as _Evasion_.\r\r### Saving Throw\rThis property allows you to configure a saving throw for the trap which is\rrolled automatically for each affected character.\r\rThe first prompt asks for which saving throw to use.\r\rThe second prompt asks for the saving throw's DC.\r\rThe third prompt asks whether the result of the saving throw should be visible\ronly to the GM, hidden from the players.\r\r### Passive Detection DC\rThis property specifies the passive Perception score needed for a character to\rpassively detect the trap.\r\r## Help\r\rMy scripts are provided 'as-is', without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.\r\rThat said, if you experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,\rplease shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/stephen-l\r\rWhen messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that\rappear in your API Console Log, any configurations you've got set up for the\rscript in the VTT, and any options you've got set up for the script on your\rgame's API Scripts page. The more information you provide me, the better the\rchances I'll be able to help.\r\r## Show Support\r\rIf you would like to show your appreciation and support for the work I do in writing,\rupdating, maintaining, and providing tech support my API scripts,\rplease consider buying one of my art packs from the Roll20 marketplace:\r\rhttps://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/search?category=itemtype:Art&author=Stephen%20Lindberg|Stephen%20L\r",
