# It's A Trap!

_v3.9 Updates:_
* Implemented delayed activation for traps. See the 'Delay Activation' property.

This is a script that allows GMs to quickly and very easily set up traps,
secret doors, and other hidden things on the GM layer, and detect when tokens
on the objects layer move over them. This trap detection even works for tokens
moving by waypoints.

Combined with modules called Trap Themes, this script also allows system-specific
automation of trap effects and passive perception used to spot them.

### Creating traps:

Place the token for your trap on the ```GM layer```.
Then, select the trap token and activate its 'ItsATrap_trapCreationWizard' token macro.
This will present a menu for setting up the trap's configurations.

### Setting trap triggers:

As of version 3.3, traps can be set to be triggered either by their own token or
by a set of paths on the GM layer. By default, the trap's token is used as
its trigger.

You can change this by opening the trap's creation wizard in the chat,
selecting a set of polygonal or freehand paths from the GM layer, and then setting
the ```Set Trigger``` property for the trap to ```Paths```.

Note: Elliptical token shapes are not currently supported (unless they are circles).

### Activating traps:

If a token moves across a trap or its trigger paths at ANY point during its
movement, the trap will be activated!

A trap can also be manually activated by clicking the 'Activate Trap' button
in the trap's configuration menu.

As of version 3.7, traps can be set to have their activation areas be either the
trap tokens themselves or be a set of paths on the GM layer. By default, the trap's
token is still used as the activation area. You can change this by selecting a
set of polygonal or freehand paths from the GM layer, and then setting  
the ```Trap Shape``` property for the trap to ```Paths```. This supports paths
both as lines (no fill color) and polygons (requires fill color).

### TrapThemes:

TrapThemes are used to provide support for formatting messages for traps and
automating system-specific trap activation and passive search mechanics.

By default the ```default``` theme will be used. This is a very basic,
system-agnostic TrapTheme which provides support for the basic TrapEffect properties
and has no passive search mechanics.

If you install a system-specific trap theme, then It's A Trap will automatically use
that theme instead.

Additional system-specific themes are available as their own API scripts.
If you would like to implement a TrapTheme for your system, take a look at
the ```default``` or ```5E-OGL``` TrapThemes as an example to get you started.
