    "description": "# It's A Trap!\r\r###### Required Scripts\r* [Token Collisions](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts/tree/master/Token%20Collisions)\r* [Vector Math](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts/tree/master/Vector%20Math)\r\r###### Updates\r'''2.1'''\r* Refactored code.\r* ItsATrap now exposes an API for its functions.\r* Customizable trap messages via GM notes.\r\rThis is a script that allows GMs to quickly and very easily set up traps on\rthe GM layer, and detect when tokens on the objects layer move over them. This\rtrap detection even works for tokens moving by waypoints.\r\r### Creating traps:\r\rPlace the token for your trap on the ```GM layer```. Give it the ```cobweb``` <img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/cobweb.png\" width=\"32\"> status marker.\r\r<br/><br/>\rBy default, traps will only affect characters on the ground (ones that don't\rhave a ```wing``` <img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/fluffy-wing.png\" width=\"32\"> or ```angel``` <img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/angel-outfit.png\" width=\"32\"> status marker). To have a trap also affect flying\rcharacters, give it the ```wing``` <img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/fluffy-wing.png\" width=\"32\"> or ```angel``` <img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/angel-outfit.png\" width=\"32\"> status marker.\r\r<br/><br/>\rBy default, trap tokens won't appear when they are activated. If you would\rlike the trap to become visible to the players when it is activated, give it\rthe ```bleeding eye``` <img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/bleeding-eye.png\" width=\"32\"> status marker. When the trap is activated, it will be moved to the ```Objects layer```.\r\r### Customizing trap messages:\r\rBy default, when a character activates a trap, it will just display a\rgeneric message that the character activated the trap.\r\rYou can specify a custom message, which can include inline\rrolls, in the GM notes for the trap. Admiral Ackbar will still dramatically\rannounce it.\r\r### Activating traps:\r\rIf a token moves across a trap at ANY point during its movement, the trap will\rbe activated!\r",
