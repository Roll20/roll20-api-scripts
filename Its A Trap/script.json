    "description": "# It's A Trap!\r\r_v3.7 Updates:_\r* Paths can now be used as the activation areas for a trap. This supports both lines and polygons (requires fill color).\r* Passive search will notice activation paths for traps.\r* You can now set traps to be destroyed after they are activated.\r* Support for multiple API commands. Each command given in the API Command property should be separated with ';;'.\r* D20 themes will actively disallow a trap to have both an attack roll and a saving throw. If an attack roll is set, the saving throw settings are cleared, and if a saving throw is set, then the attack settings are cleared.\r\rThis is a script that allows GMs to quickly and very easily set up traps,\rsecret doors, and other hidden things on the GM layer, and detect when tokens\ron the objects layer move over them. This trap detection even works for tokens\rmoving by waypoints.\r\rCombined with modules called Trap Themes, this script also allows system-specific\rautomation of trap effects and passive perception used to spot them.\r\r### Creating traps:\r\rPlace the token for your trap on the ```GM layer```.\rThen, select the trap token and activate its 'ItsATrap_trapCreationWizard' token macro.\rThis will present a menu for setting up the trap's configurations.\r\r### Setting trap triggers:\r\rAs of version 3.3, traps can be set to be triggered either by their own token or\rby a set of paths on the GM layer. By default, the trap's token is used as\rits trigger.\r\rYou can change this by opening the trap's creation wizard in the chat,\rselecting a set of polygonal or freehand paths from the GM layer, and then setting\rthe ```Set Trigger``` property for the trap to ```Paths```.\r\rNote: Elliptical token shapes are not currently supported (unless they are circles).\r\r### Activating traps:\r\rIf a token moves across a trap or its trigger paths at ANY point during its\rmovement, the trap will be activated!\r\rA trap can also be manually activated by clicking the 'Activate Trap' button\rin the trap's configuration menu.\r\rAs of version 3.7, traps can be set to have their activation areas be either the\rtrap tokens themselves or be a set of paths on the GM layer. By default, the trap's\rtoken is still used as the activation area. You can change this by selecting a\rset of polygonal or freehand paths from the GM layer, and then setting  \rthe ```Trap Shape``` property for the trap to ```Paths```. This supports paths\rboth as lines (no fill color) and polygons (requires fill color).\r\r### TrapThemes:\r\rTrapThemes are used to provide support for formatting messages for traps and\rautomating system-specific trap activation and passive search mechanics.\r\rBy default the ```default``` theme will be used. This is a very basic,\rsystem-agnostic TrapTheme which provides support for the basic TrapEffect properties\rand has no passive search mechanics.\r\rIf you install a system-specific trap theme, then It's A Trap will automatically use\rthat theme instead.\r\rAdditional system-specific themes are available as their own API scripts.\rIf you would like to implement a TrapTheme for your system, take a look at\rthe ```default``` or ```5E-OGL``` TrapThemes as an example to get you started.\r\r## Help\r\rIf you experience any issues while using this script or the trap themes,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature, please reply to this thread:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/forum/post/3280344/script-its-a-trap-v2-dot-3\ror shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/stephen-l\r\r## Show Support\r\rIf you would like to show your appreciation and support for the work I do in writing,\rupdating, and maintaining my API scripts, consider buying one of my art packs from the Roll20 marketplace (https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/search/?keywords=&sortby=newest&type=all&genre=all&author=Stephen%20Lindberg)\ror, simply leave a thank you note in the script's thread on the Roll20 forums.\rEither is greatly appreciated!
