    "description": "# Welcome Package\r\rThis script welcomes new players to your game and creates a blank new character\rfor them to begin building immediately.\r\rNormally, this would be a back and forth process with various steps depending the schedules of you and your players:\r* Player joins your campaign, can't do anything, and logs off.\r* You login, create a blank character for the player, and then log off.\r* The player eventually gets back on and builds their character.\r\rWith this script there is only one step:\r* Player joins your campaign and can immediately start building their character.\r\rThe script also installs a macro for each player named \"CreateACharacter\"\rwhich allows the players to create additional new characters with a\rspecified name.\r\r## Help\r\rMy scripts are provided 'as-is', without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.\r\rThat said, if you experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,\rplease shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l\r\rWhen messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that\rappear in your API Console Log, any configurations you've got set up for the\rscript in the VTT, and any options you've got set up for the script on your\rgame's API Scripts page. The more information you provide me, the better the\rchances I'll be able to help.\r\r## Show Support\r\rIf you would like to show your appreciation and support for the work I do in writing,\rupdating, maintaining, and providing tech support my API scripts,\rplease consider buying one of my art packs from the Roll20 marketplace:\r\rhttps://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/publisher/165/ada-lindberg\r",
