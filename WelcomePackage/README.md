# Welcome Package

This script welcomes new players to your game and creates a blank new character
for them to begin building immediately.

Normally, this would be a back and forth process with various steps depending the schedules of you and your players:
* Player joins your campaign, can't do anything, and logs off.
* You login, create a blank character for the player, and then log off.
* The player eventually gets back on and builds their character.

With this script there is only one step:
* Player joins your campaign and can immediately start building their character.

The script also installs a macro for each player named "CreateACharacter"
which allows the players to create additional new characters with a
specified name.
