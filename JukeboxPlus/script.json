Tracks are displayed on the right, and control buttons appear for each one. \n \n--- \n \n## Getting Started \n\nJukebox Plus lets you organize and control music tracks by **albums** or **playlists**. \nUse the toggle buttons in the sidebar to switch between views. Tracks are displayed on the right, and control buttons appear for each one. \n \n--- \n \n## Header Buttons \n\nAt the top right of the interface: \n \n`Play All`&nbsp;`Together`&nbsp;`In Order`&nbsp;`Loop`&nbsp;`Mix`  \n`Loop All`&nbsp;`Off`&nbsp;`On`  \n`Stop All`&nbsp;`Find`&nbsp;`Help` \n \n### Button Descriptions \n \n**Play All**  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Together** - Plays all visible tracks simultaneously. Limited to the first five visible.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**In Order** - Plays all visible tracks one after the other.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Loop** - Plays all visible tracks one after the other, then starts over.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Mix** - Plays all looping tracks continuously, and all other tracks at random intervals. Use to create a custom soundscape. Stopped by `Stop All`. The non-looping tracks will play at intervals between 12–25 seconds, randomly chosen. \n \n**Loop All**  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Off** - Disables loop mode for all visible tracks  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**On** - Enables loop mode for all visible tracks \n \n**Stop All** - Stops all currently playing tracks. Also use to stop a Mix.  \n**Find** - Search all track names and descriptions for the keyword. All matching tracks will be assigned to a temporary album called **Found**. You can then switch to the Found album to quickly view the results. To clear the results, simply delete the Found album using the Utility panel. \nIf you input \"d\" as the search term, it will create a temporary playlist of any duplicate tracks, grouped by name.  \n**Help** - Displays this help page. Click **Return to Player** to return. \n \n--- \n \n## Sidebar: Navigation & Now Playing \n \n**View Mode Toggle** \n\nThe left sidebar lists all albums or playlists, depending on the current view mode. Clicking a name switches the view. \n \n`Albums`&nbsp;&nbsp;`Playlists` \n\nThese buttons let you switch between organizing by:  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Albums** you define and tag yourself  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Playlists** as defined in the Roll20 Jukebox system (not editable here) \n\nAt the bottom of the list:  \n`Now Playing` - Filters the list to show only tracks currently playing. \n \n--- \n \n## Track Controls \n\nEach track shows these control buttons (these will be graphic buttons when viewed in the game): \n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`play` **Play** - Start the track  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`loop` **Loop** - Toggle loop mode for the track  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`isolate` **Isolate** - Stops all others and plays only this one  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`stop` **Stop** - Stops this track  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`announce` **Announce** - Sends the track name and description to the chat window \n \n--- \n \n## Track Info and Management \n \n**Edit** - Click the track description \"edit\" link to create a description. \n\nDescription special characters: \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`---` inserts a line break \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`*italic*` uses single asterisks for italic text \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`**bold**` uses double asterisks for bold text \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`!d` or `!desc` includes the description when you Announce a track \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`!a` or `!announce` makes the track auto-announce on play \n \n**Tags** \nEach track has a Playlist tag and may have one or more Album tags.  \n- `Playlist` tags are in blue  \n- `Album` tags are in red  \n\nClick `+ Add` to add an Album tag. \nClick a tag to jump to that Album or Playlist. \nClick the `x` on an Album tag to remove it: `Album name | x` \n \n**Image Area** \nClick the image area to enter either: \n- a valid image URL \n- a CSS color name (e.g. \"red\") \n- a hexadecimal color code (e.g. `#00ff00`) \n\nIf you provide an image URL, it will display beside the track name and in the chat on announce. \nIf you provide a color code, the square will show that color and use it when Announcing. \n \n--- \n \n## Utility Panel \n\nClick `Settings` to expand the utility tools. Includes: \n \n### Album Controls \n`Edit Albums:`&nbsp;`-`&nbsp;`+`&nbsp;`edit pencil icon`  \nRename, add, or delete the currently selected album \n \n### Sorting \nA—Z:&nbsp;&nbsp;`albums`&nbsp;`tracks`  \nAlphabetize Albums or the tracks within an Album \n \n### Mode \nMode:&nbsp;&nbsp;`dark`&nbsp;`light`  \nSwitch between dark and light interface modes \n \n### Refresh \n`Refresh` - Rebuilds the interface if something breaks \n \n### Backup \nBackup:&nbsp;&nbsp;`make`&nbsp;`restore`  \n- Create or restore from backup handouts containing your album and playlist data  \n- Use this to move data between games via the Roll20 Transmogrifier \n \n**Note:** Tracks are linked by ID, which changes between games. The script tries to match by name during restore, but renames and duplicates may cause mismatches. \n \n--- \n \n## Find \n\nUse the `!jb find keyword` command to search all track names and descriptions. \nMatching tracks are added to a temporary album called **Found**. \nDelete the Found album to clear the search results. \n \n--- \n \n## Useful Macros \n\nHere are some chat commands you can use in macros: \n \n- `!jb` - Show link to open the interface  \n- `!jb play TrackName` - Play the named track  \n- `!jb stopall` - Stop all currently playing audio  \n- `!jb loopall` - Enable loop mode for visible tracks  \n- `!jb unloopall` - Disable loop mode on all tracks  \n- `!jb jump album AlbumName` - Switch to the given album  \n- `!jb help` - Open this help screen  \n- `!jb find keyword` - Search for keyword and assign matches to the \"Found\" album \n\nYou can also discover commands by pressing a control button, clicking in the chat window, and pressing the **Up Arrow** to see what was sent. \n \n",
