Tracks are displayed on the right, and control buttons appear for each one. \n \n--- \n \n## Header Buttons \n\nAt the top right of the interface: \n \n`Play All`&nbsp;`Together`&nbsp;`In Order`&nbsp;`Loop`&nbsp;`Mix`  \n`Loop All`&nbsp;`Off`&nbsp;`On`  \n`Stop All`&nbsp;`Find`&nbsp;`Help` \n \n### Button Descriptions \n \n**Play All**  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Together** - Plays all visible tracks simultaneously. Limited to the first five visible.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**In Order** - Plays all visible tracks one after the other.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Loop** - Plays all visible tracks one after the other, then starts over.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Mix** - Plays all looping tracks continuously, and all other tracks at random intervals. Use to create a custom soundscape. Stopped by `Stop All`. \n \n**Loop All**  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Off** - Disables loop mode for all visible tracks  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**On** - Enables loop mode for all visible tracks \n \n**Stop All** - Stops all currently playing tracks. Also use to stop a Mix.  \n**Find** - Search all track names and descriptions for the keyword. All matching tracks will be assigned to a temporary album called **Found**. You can then switch to the Found album to quickly view the results. To clear the results, simply delete the Found album using the Utility panel. \nIf you input \"d\" as the search term, it will create a temporary playlist of any duplicate tracks, grouped by name.  \n**Help** - Displays this help page. Click **Return to Player** to return. \n \n--- \n \n## Sidebar: Navigation & Now Playing \n \n**View Mode Toggle** \n\nThe left sidebar lists all albums or playlists, depending on the current view mode.

The script tries to match by name during restore, but renames and duplicates may cause mismatches. \n \n--- \n \n## Find \n\nUse the `!jb find keyword` command to search all track names and descriptions. \nMatching tracks are added to a temporary album called **Found**. \nDelete the Found album to clear the search results. \n \n--- \n \n## Useful Macros \n\nHere are some chat commands you can use in macros: \n \n- `!jb` - Show link to open the interface  \n- `!jb play TrackName` - Play the named track  \n- `!jb stopall` - Stop all currently playing audio  \n- `!jb loopall` - Enable loop mode for visible tracks  \n- `!jb unloopall` - Disable loop mode on all tracks  \n- `!jb jump album AlbumName` - Switch to the given album  \n- `!jb help` - Open this help screen  \n- `!jb find keyword` - Search for keyword and assign matches to the \"Found\" album \n\nYou can also discover commands by pressing a control button, clicking in the chat window, and pressing the **Up Arrow** to see what was sent. \n \n",
