Click [+ Add] to add an Album tag.  
Click a tag to jump to that Album or Playlist.  
Click the "x" on an Album tag to remove it: `Album name | x`

If you provide an image URL, it will display beside the track name and in the chat on announce.  
If you provide a color code, the square will show that color and use it when Announcing.
