Hunter's Mark
=============

A script that lets each character have their own custom Status Marker, which they can use to mark other tokens. You can make only one target at a time. When you mark a new target, the old marker is removed. This is perfect for abilities like D&D's Hunter's Mark.

Run it with !hunters-mark followed by one of the commands below.

Available Commands
==================

* `help`: Shows a help file like this one.
* `add`: Select a character, and make sure they have one status marker applied. Then click Add, and that character will be added to the list of hunters, and the marker will be the one they use to mark targets.
* `delete`: Delete a character from the list of hunters.
* `show`: Show a list of hunters, their markers, and their current marked target, if any.
* `menu`: prints a set of buttons, to activate the scripts commands.

Marking or Unmarking a Target
=============================

* `!hunters-mark @{selected|character_id} @{target|token_id}`: To mark or unmark a target, you need to supply your character id, and the token id of a target. The same command is used to mark or unmark a target.
