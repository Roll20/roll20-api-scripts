    "description": "# It's A Trap! - Pathfinder Generic theme\r\r_3.5 Updates_\r* Added support for Roll20's official Pathfinder sheet.\r\rThis is a Pathfinder trap theme built to support all Pathfinder character sheets and Pathfinder characters\rwho use plain attributes instead of character sheets.\r\rThis trap theme provides built-in support for Roll20's official Pathfinder sheet; Samuel Marino, Nibrodooh,\rVince, Samuel Terrazas, chris-b, Magik, and James W.'s community Pathfinder sheet; and for\rmy own Pathfinder 'Simple' sheet.\r\rOther sheets, custom sheets, and characters based upon plain attributes are also supported.\rFor those, just fill in the names for the character attributes in the user options for\rthis script.\r\r## Theme-specific properties\rThe following trap properties are specific to this trap theme script.\r\r### Attack Bonus\rThe modifier for the trap's attack roll, if it makes an attack roll.\r\r### Attack vs\rThis property specifies whether the trap's attack roll is against its victim's\rAC, touch AC, or CMD.\r\r### Damage\rA dice expression for the damage dealt by the trap on a hit. This does not\rtake any damage resistances or immunities into account.\r\r### Hide Save Result\rThis property specifies whether the result of the trap's saving throws will be\rhidden from the players.\r\r### Miss - Half Damage\rThis property specifies whether victims of the trap will still take half damage,\reven if they avoided the trap. This does not take into account any special\rabilities such as Evasion.\r\r### Saving Throw\rIf the trap allows a saving throw, choose which saving throw it uses with this\rproperty.\r\r### Saving Throw DC\rThis property specifies the DC for the above saving throw.\r\r### Spot DC\rThis property specifies the passive Perecption (10 + Perception skill modifier)\rneeded for a character to passively spot the trap.\r\r## Trap Spotter ability\r\rFor built-in sheets, This Trap Theme supports the Rogue's Trap Spotter talent. It works for any\rcharacter that has Trap Spotter in the Class Abilities section of their\rcharacter sheet.\r\rWhen the character approaches within 10' of a trap, they will\rautomatically get a perception check to try to notice the trap. The results\rof this check are sent to the GM. If the Perception check is successful, the\rplayers are also alerted about the trap's presence.\r\rThis ability only works with traps whose type is 'trap'. For the character's\rPerception check, it uses their Perception skill total on their character sheet,\rso it doesn't take into account any situational bonuses. It is the GM's job\rto account for any situational bonuses that might contribute to the hidden\rPerception check when the result is displayed to them.\r\r## Help\r\rDue to complications with the API reading attributes from certain character sheets,\rthere have been issues in the past with things such as saving throws or passive perception\rnot being correct. If this happens, first try adjusting the values for these on\ryour character sheet or try re-creating the character sheet from scratch to see\rif that resolves the problem.\r\rIf you continue to experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature, please reply to this thread:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/forum/post/3280344/script-its-a-trap-v2-dot-3\ror shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/stephen-l\r\r## Show Support\r\rIf you would like to show your appreciation and support for the work I do in writing,\rupdating, and maintaining my API scripts, consider buying one of my art packs from the Roll20 marketplace (https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/search/?keywords=&sortby=newest&type=all&genre=all&author=Stephen%20Lindberg)\ror, simply leave a thank you note in the script's thread on the Roll20 forums.\rEither is greatly appreciated! Happy gaming!\r",
