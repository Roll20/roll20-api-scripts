# Carry Tokens

This script allows you to set tokens to carry each other, either as a
character holding an item, or as a mount carrying a rider. The carried
token will always set its position to that of the carrying token. When you
move the carrier around, the carried token will follow.

## To Use

When this script is installed, it creates a CarryTokensMenu macro which
displays a menu for this script in the VTT's chat. This menu has the following
commands:

### Carry Above
This command allows you to have a token carry another above it on the Z-axis.
This is most helpful when you need a large token such as a mount to carry
a smaller token such as a rider.

To use this, first select the carrier token and then click the Carry Above
command. When prompted, click on the token you want to carry.

### Carry Below
This command allows you to have a token carry another below it on the Z-axis.
This is most helpful when you need a token to carry a token of the same size or
smaller, for example when you want a character to carry an item such as a
torch.

To use this, first select the carrier token and then click the Carry Below
command. When prompted, click on the token you want to carry.

### Drop by Name
This command makes a token drop another token it is carrying.

To use this, select the carrier token and then click the Drop by Name command.
When prompted, enter the name of the token you want to drop.

You can also cause a token to stop being carried by moving it away from
the token carrying it.

### Drop All
This command makes a token drop all other tokens it is carrying.

To use this, select the carrier token and then click the Drop All command.
