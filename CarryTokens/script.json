    "description": "# Carry Tokens\r\rThis script allows you to set tokens to carry each other, either as a\rcharacter holding an item, or as a mount carrying a rider. The carried\rtoken will always set its position to that of the carrying token. When you\rmove the carrier around, the carried token will follow.\r\r## To Use\r\rWhen this script is installed, it creates a CarryTokensMenu macro which\rdisplays a menu for this script in the VTT's chat. This menu has the following\rcommands:\r\r### Carry Above\rThis command allows you to have a token carry another above it on the Z-axis.\rThis is most helpful when you need a large token such as a mount to carry\ra smaller token such as a rider.\r\rTo use this, first select the carrier token and then click the Carry Above\rcommand. When prompted, click on the token you want to carry.\r\r### Carry Below\rThis command allows you to have a token carry another below it on the Z-axis.\rThis is most helpful when you need a token to carry a token of the same size or\rsmaller, for example when you want a character to carry an item such as a\rtorch.\r\rTo use this, first select the carrier token and then click the Carry Below\rcommand. When prompted, click on the token you want to carry.\r\r### Drop by Name\rThis command makes a token drop another token it is carrying.\r\rTo use this, select the carrier token and then click the Drop by Name command.\rWhen prompted, enter the name of the token you want to drop.\r\rYou can also cause a token to stop being carried by moving it away from\rthe token carrying it.\r\r### Drop All\rThis command makes a token drop all other tokens it is carrying.\r\rTo use this, select the carrier token and then click the Drop All command.\r\r## Help\r\rMy scripts are provided 'as-is', without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.\r\rThat said, if you experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,\rplease shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/stephen-l\r\rWhen messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that\rappear in your API Console Log, any configurations you've got set up for the\rscript in the VTT, and any options you've got set up for the script on your\rgame's API Scripts page. The more information you provide me, the better the\rchances I'll be able to help.\r\r## Show Support\r\rIf you would like to show your appreciation and support for the work I do in writing,\rupdating, maintaining, and providing tech support my API scripts,\rplease consider buying one of my art packs from the Roll20 marketplace:\r\rhttps://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/search?category=itemtype:Art&author=Stephen%20Lindberg|Stephen%20L\r",
