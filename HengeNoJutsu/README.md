My wife plays a Kitsune trickster cleric which can switch freely between the Kitsune and a human form so I thought the Naruto "Henge no Jutsu" style of changing tokens would be cool :)

Henge No Jutsu transforms a token image between two saved states with only one command (or macro) and a little smoke effect.

See it here in action:

### Usage
 1. Create a rollable table with two images 
 2. Select the desired token
 3. !hengenojutsu [rollatable name]
