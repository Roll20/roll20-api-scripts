  "description": "# 5E Resting in Style\n\nThis script for the 5E OGL character sheet solves the error prone task of updating your character sheet when resting. Using !long-rest and !short-rest commands will update your sheet, and report to you everything it is doing.\n\n## Short rest\n\nSelect your character, then run the `!short-rest` command. It will:\n\n- check your hit points and hit dice, and remind you to use them if needed.\n\n- replenish Warlock **Pact Magic** spell slots. This works correctly even if you\n  are a multiclass spell caster.\n\n- replenish class specific resources, like **Wild Shape**, **Second Wind** and **Channel Divinity**.\n\n    - It knows that Bards regain **Bardic Inspiration** at class level 5.\n\n    - It knows that Sorcerers gain 4 Sorcery Points at class level 20.\n\n- replenish subclass specific resources, like **Superiority Dice** and **Hexblade's Curse**.\n\n- remind Wizards to use **Arcane Recovery**, and Bards to use **Song of Rest**.\n\n- turn off global modifiers with a short duration, like **Bless**, **Sacred Weapon** and **Shield of Faith**.\n\n## Long rest\n\nSelect your character, then run the `!long-rest` command. It will:\n\n- replenish your hit points.\n\n- replenish the correct number of hit dice (even at lvl 1).\n\n- remove temporary hit points.\n\n- reduce exhaustion level.\n\n- replenish spell slots.\n\n- replenish class specific resources, like **Lay on Hands**, **Arcane Recovery** and **Rage**.\n\n- replenish subclass specific resources, like **Consult the Spirits** and **Avenging Angel**.\n\n- replenish race specific resources, like **Breath Weapon** and **Relentless Endurance**.\n\n- turn off global modifiers with long durations, like **Mage Armor**.\n\n## Usage\n\nResting in Style will generally do the right thing out of the box, as long as\nyou're using the 5th Edition OGL by Roll20 character sheet.\n\nHowever, not all resources are automatically added to the Resource boxes. You\nmight have to add them yourself.\n\nFor instance, a Wizard starts with the **Arcane Recovery** skill. This is not\ntracked in the sheet. Add a custom resource box, set the Total to 1, the value\nto 1, and the name to \"Arcane Recovery\".\n\nResting in Style will detect the new resource by name, and start notifying you\nto use it on short rests, and replenish it on long rests.\n\n### I have a resource not covered by this script\n\nNo worries. If your skill is called \"Homebrew Resource\", you can rename it to\n\"Homebrew Resource [l]\" to reset it every long rest. If you instead postfix it\nwith \"[s]\", then it is reset every short and long rest.\n\nAlso: Please let me know if I have missed any skills in the official source\nbooks, I'll happily add the support.\n\n### What about items with randomly regained charges?\n\nLet's look at Wand of Magic Missiles. The wand regains 1d6+1 expended charges\ndaily at dawn. We can approximate that by tying it to a long rest like this:\n\n```\nWand of Magic Missiles [l+1d6+1]\n```\n\nThe first character in the brackets is a lower case L, meaning it will trigger\nafter a long rest. The `+1d6+1` is rolled and added to the resource (up to the\nmaximum). You can replace the `l` with an `s` to trigger after a short rest. \n\n## Oddities\n\nFor technical reasons, if you want DeathTracker to notice changes in hitpoints\nafter resting, you must also install the TokenMod script.",
