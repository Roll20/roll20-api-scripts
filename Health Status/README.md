In the old CRPGs (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale), you could hover your cursor over a monster and see *roughly* how much health it had. This script aims to let you and your players do just that.

## Commands
__!hp [token\_id]__<br />
Used to show the current HP of the target in game chat. Running this command from a macro lets your players use it too.
You can use this macro below in your game.
```
!hp @{target|token_id}
```
