    "description": "# One-Way Dynamic Lighting\r\rThis script allows you to set up dynamic lighting walls that allow you to\rsee through one side, but not the other.\r\r### Creating Walls\r\rTo create a one-way dynamic lighting wall, you need to create a path for the wall itself and\ra filled path representing a area from which characters can see through the wall. Once you have those\rtwo objects created, select both of them, and activate the ```OneWayDynamicLighting``` macro installed\rby this script. That's all there is to it!\r\r__Note:__\rDue to limitations of the API, if at least one player character is on the visible\rside of the wall, then all characters will be able to see through it, even if\ryour dynamic lighting is set to require line-of-sight. This is because it works by\rmoving the one-way walls back and forth from the GM layer and the Dynamic Lighting layer,\rwhich at any point in time is the same for everyone.\r\rAlas, there are some paradigms I've considered when implementing this script that\rwould allow each character to have their own perspective of the dynamic lighting.\rUnfortunately, this would only be possible if it were implemented in Roll20's\rdynamic lighting system itself using some WebGL magic involving stencil buffers\rand lighting polygon unions.\r\rA while ago, I presented an algorithm for\rimplementing one-way dynamic lighting in the dynamic lighting system detailed in\rmy post here: https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/4804351/questions-roll20-roundtable-hour-number-1-q1-2017/?pageforid=4806305#post-4806305\rIf it's compatible with their current system, maybe the Roll20 developers can make use of it.\rFor the time being though, I hope that this humble script will suffice for everyone's\rone-way dynamic lighting needs.\r\r### Help\r\rIf you experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature, please\rpost to the script's thread in the API forums or shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/stephen-l\r\r### Show Support\r\rIf you would like to show your appreciation and support for the work I do in writing,\rupdating, and maintaining my API scripts, consider buying one of my art packs from the Roll20 marketplace (https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/search/?keywords=&sortby=newest&type=all&genre=all&author=Stephen%20Lindberg)\ror, simply leave a thank you note in the script's thread on the Roll20 forums.\rEither is greatly appreciated! Happy gaming!\r",
