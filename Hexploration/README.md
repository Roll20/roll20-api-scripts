# Hexploration

_v1.3 Updates:_
* Fixed a couple state bugs.

This script allows GMs to draw a polygon on a hex-gridded map and fill in
each hex inside that polygon with an opaque hexagon. It's great for hex-based
maps where the PCs must explore and discover each area hex by hex.

## General Usage

This script's actions and configurations are accessible through its menu
displayed in the chat (Visible only to the GM).
To open the script's menu, activate the 'Hexploration_menu' macro installed
by the script.

Note that this script only works for maps whose grid types are set to either
'Hex (V)' or 'Hex (H)'. The opaque hexes will be aligned to the page's hex
grid.

When you move a token representing a character into an area concealed by a hex,
the hex will be revealed. If the script's reveal distance is set greater than 0,
then adjacent hexes out to that distance (in hex units) will also be revealed.

Watch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts/master/Hexploration/Hexploration.gif
for a short demo of the basics of how the script works.

### Rendering Hexes

To create a hex-filled area, first draw one or more polygons containing the
area you want filled with hexes. Then select the polygons and press the
'Fill Polygon' action from the script's menu. That's it!

### Naming Hexes

Hexes can be named to represent locations that are concealing. The names of
the hexes will be shown on the GM layer, invisible to the PCs. When a named
hex is revealed, it will announce that its location has been discovered in the
chat.

There are two ways to name locations hidden by hexes:

Before rendering the hexes using the 'Fill Polygon' action, create named tokens
with the 'white-tower' status representing the locations you want to conceal
with the hexes. This will also set the icon for the hex to that of the named
token.

To name a hex that's already been rendered, select the hex and set its name
using the 'Name Hex' action from the menu.

### Setting a Hex's Icon

Hexes can be assigned a named icon. The icon will be hidden on the GM layer,
and it and its name will be revealed when its hex is revealed.

To make a hex with an icon, create a named token with the 'white-tower' status
representing the location you want to conceal within a hex. Then fill the area
containing that token with hexes. It will be automatically concealed and
assigned to the hex it was in.

## Actions

The script contains the following actions available from the script's chat menu:

### Fill Polygon

This renders hexes within one more more polygon areas.
Select one or more polygons, then use this action to fill their areas with
hexes.

### Inverse Fill

This works like the 'Fill Polygon' action, except that it renders hexes
everywhere on the page except inside the selected polygons' areas instead.

### Name Hex

This allows you to name a hex after it has been rendered. Select the hex you
want to name, then use this action to specify a name for it.

## Configurations

The script contains the following configurations that can be set from the
script's chat menu:

### Drawing configs

These configurations set properties for hexes as you are drawing them.

#### Hex Color

This allows you to specify the color, border color, and label color of hexes.

#### Border Width

This sets the width of the border outlines on hexes.

#### Hex Reveal Distance

If this is set, then a character can only reveal the hexes being drawn if they
are within the specified number of hexes away from them.

E.g., if a hex is drawn while this config is set to 3, then a character must be
within 3 hexes from it to reveal it. The hex will not be revealed if the
character is 4 or more hexes away from it, even if the global reveal distance
is set very high.

If this is not set, then the hex can be revealed from a theoretically infinite
distance away (out to the line of sight distance).

### Global configs

These configs apply globally throughout the use of this script.

#### Line of Sight

This is the global reveal distance. It specifies how far out (in units) hexes
are revealed when a character token is moved.
