# Hexploration

This script allows GMs to draw a polygon on a hex-gridded map and fill in
each hex inside that polygon with an opaque hexagon. It's great for hex-based
maps where the PCs must explore and discover each area hex by hex.

Pair this script with the It's A Trap! script to announce new locations as
the PCs stumble upon them!

## Usage

To create a hex-filled area, first draw a polygon containing the area you
want filled with hexes. Then select the polygon and activate the
'Hexploration_fill' macro installed by this script. That's it!

Note that this script only works for maps whose grid types are set to either
'Hex (V)' or 'Hex (H)'. The opaque hexes will be aligned to the page's hex
grid.

When you move a token representing a character into an area concealed by a hex,
the hex will be removed.
