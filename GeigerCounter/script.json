    "description": "# Geiger Counter\r\rThis script allows the GM to dynamically create radioactive areas in their maps. Characters that have Geiger counters will be alerted how many rads they are taking.\r\r## To create a radioactive source object:\r1. Create a token representing the source on the GM layer.\r2. Set that token's 'radioactive' <img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/radioactive.png\" width=\"32\"> status marker to on.\r3. Set its ```aura1 radius``` to the distance at which characters will start taking rads from it.\r4. Set the ```bar1``` value to amount of rads/s characters will take at the edge of its aura.\r5. Set the ```bar1 max value``` to the maximum amount of rads/s characters can take from it.\r\r## To give a player a Geiger counter:\r1. Give them a ```'hasGeigerCounter' attribute```.\r2. Set the attribute to ```true```.\r\rIf a character moves in a radioactive area and they have a Geiger counter, their Geiger counter will alert everyone how many rads/s they are taking. If a character moves in a radioactive area and they don't have a Geiger counter, only the GM will be alerted how many rads/s they are taking.",
