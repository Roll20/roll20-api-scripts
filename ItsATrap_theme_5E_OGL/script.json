If this happens, first try adjusting the values for these on\ryour character sheet or try re-creating the character sheet from scratch to see\rif that resolves the problem.\r\rIf you continue to experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature, please reply to this thread:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/forum/post/3280344/script-its-a-trap-v2-dot-3\ror shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/stephen-l\r\r## Show Support\r\rIf you would like to show your appreciation and support for the work I do in writing,\rupdating, and maintaining my API scripts, consider buying one of my art packs from the Roll20 marketplace (https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/search/?keywords=&sortby=newest&type=all&genre=all&author=Stephen%20Lindberg)\ror, simply leave a thank you note in the script's thread on the Roll20 forums.\rEither is greatly appreciated!
