    "description": "# Custom Status Markers\r\r###### Required Scripts\r* [Path Math](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts/tree/master/PathMath)\r\rAllows users to create custom status markers and set them onto tokens.\r\r## Creating status markers\r\rYou can create markers either as graphics or as drawn paths. When you've\rchosen the graphic/made your drawing for the marker, do the following to\rsave it:\r1) Select the marker's graphic/drawing paths.\r2) Enter ```!saveMarker NAME``` in the chat, where ```NAME``` is the name you want to\rsave the custom status marker as.\r\re.g. ```!saveMarker sleep```\r\rWhen the marker is saved, a confirmation message will be displayed in the chat.\r\r## Setting/toggling status markers on tokens\r\r1) Select one or more tokens to assign the status maker to.\r2) In the chat, enter ```!setMarker NAME [COUNT]```.\r\r```NAME``` is the name of the saved custom status marker.\r```[COUNT]``` is an optional number badge to put on the status marker.\r\rThe status marker will be toggled for each selected token. If count is\rspecified, the status marker will include count as a text badge.\r\re.g. ```!setMarker sleep``` or ```!setMarker poison 3```\r\r## Listing status markers\r\rYou can view the list of custom status markers saved in your campaign\rby entering the command ```!listMarkers```.\r\r## Deleting status markers\r\rYou can delete one of your saved custom status markers by entering the command: ```!delMarker NAME```.\r\re.g. ```!delMarker sleep```\r\r## Clearing the Custom Status Markers state\r\rA command is provided for clearing the Custom Status Markers module's state: ```!clearMarkersState [tokens]```.\r\rIf a token is selected when the command is entered, only the CSM state for that\rtoken will be cleared (any custom markers on that token will stop following it).\rIf the ```tokens``` option is given, then only the CSM tokens state is cleared.\rOtherwise, both the CSM's tokens state and its saved markers are cleared.\r\r## Known issues:\r\r* Elliptical paths are not supported. As a work-around, you can approximate a\rcircle or ellipse using the polygon or freehand path tools.\r* Negatively scaled (flipped) paths are not supported. This is due to a bug in\rthe API that causes it to return the magnitude, but not the sign of a path's\rscale transform components.",
