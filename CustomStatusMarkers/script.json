This button is only available to the GM.\r\r## Options menu\rThis menu provides global configurations used by the Custom Status Markers\rscript. It is only available to the GM.\r\r### Icon Size\rThis configuration sets the size of the script's status icons, in pixels.\r\r### Icon Alignment\rThis configuration sets how custom status icons are displayed relative to\rtheir host token and built-in status markers. Options include:\r\r* Above: Custom status markers are displayed above their token.\r* Inline: Custom status markers are displayed in front of their token, alongside any built-in status markers.\r\r## Menu Actions\rThis menu has several buttons for managing the game's custom status markers.\rIt is only available to the GM.\r\r### New Status Marker\rYou can create markers from any graphic you have uploaded to your library.
