# Custom Status Markers
This script allows users to create custom status markers for tokens.
When this script is installed, it creates a 'CustomStatusMarkers' macro for
displaying the script's menu.

## Opening the menu
To open the script's menu, just run the 'CustomStatusMarkers' macro installed
by this script.

## Custom Status Markers menu
This menu shows all your game's custom status markers and allows you and your
players to toggle them on and off on tokens they control.

### Toggle
To give a token a custom status marker or to remove a custom status marker from
a token, do the following:

1. Select one or more tokens to assign the status maker to.
2. Click the 'toggle' button for the status marker button in the menu.

### Counter (# button)
You can create a numerical badge for status markers.

1. Select one or more tokens to set a status badge to.
2. Click the 'count' button for the status marker you want a badge for.
3. Enter the number for the badge. Enter nothing to remove the badge.

### Tint (rainbow button)
You can set a tint color for status marker icons.

1. Select one or more tokens to set a status badge to.
2. Click the palette button for the status marker you want to change the icon tint color for.
3. Enter in the color name or hex value. Enter nothing to remove the tint color.

### Deleting status markers
You can delete one of your saved custom status markers by clicking the 'X'
button next to it in the menu. This button is only available to the GM.

## Options menu
This menu provides global configurations used by the Custom Status Markers
script. It is only available to the GM.

### Icon Size
This configuration sets the size of the script's status icons, in pixels.

### Icon Alignment
This configuration sets how custom status icons are displayed relative to
their host token and built-in status markers. Options include:

* Above: Custom status markers are displayed above their token.
* Inline: Custom status markers are displayed in front of their token, alongside any built-in status markers.

## Menu Actions
This menu has several buttons for managing the game's custom status markers.
It is only available to the GM.

### New Status Marker
You can create markers from any graphic you have uploaded to your library. When you've
chosen the graphic for the marker, do the following to save it:

1. Select the marker's graphic.
2. Click the 'New Status Marker' button in the menu.
3. Give it a name.

### Remove Token Markers
This button removes all custom status markers currently on the selected token.

### Import/Export State
The Import State and Export State buttons allow GMs to transfer their custom
status markers between games. Clicking Export State will show the JSON data
for the current game's custom status markers. This JSON can be copied and
pasted into the Import State button's prompt in another game. Please note that
importing the state will overwrite the custom status markers already
in the game.

### Clear State
This command will clear the Custom Status Markers module's state.
Warning: This will delete all your saved custom status markers!
