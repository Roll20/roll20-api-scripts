# Custom Status Markers

_3.1 Updates_
* Added option to the chat menu to change the size of custom status icons.
* Custom status markers are now displayed above the built-in markers instead of to the left of the built-in markers.

This script allows users to create custom status markers for tokens.
When this script is installed, it creates a 'CustomStatusMarkers' macro for
displaying the script's menu.

## Opening the menu

To open the script's menu, just run the 'CustomStatusMarkers' macro installed
