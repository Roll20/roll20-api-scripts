    "description": "# Token Collisions\r\r_v1.5 Updates:_\r* Collisions with Paths and arbitrary polygons are now supported. Paths with non-transparent fills are treated as polygons.\r* All collisions are now entirely pixel-perfect.\r\r_v1.4 Updates:_\r* getCollisions and getFirstCollision now accept an options object parameter. See the CollisionOptions typedef jsdoc for supported properties.\r\r_v1.3 Updates:_\r* Supports circle-to-rectangle token collisions.\r* Added isOverlapping() function.\r\rThis script provides a small library for checking for collisions between\rtokens. It provides no functionality by itself, but it is used by other\rscripts such as ```It's A Trap``` and ```World Map Discovery```.\r\r## Rectangular tokens\r\rBy default, all tokens are assumed to be circular with a diameter equal to their\rwidth. You can set a token to be rectangular for this script by setting its\rAura1 to a square.\r\r## API Documentation:\r\rThe following functions are exposed by the ```TokenCollisions``` object:\r\r```\r/**\r * Returns the list of other tokens that some token collided with during\r * its last movement.\r * The tokens are sorted in the order they are collided with.\r * @param {Graphic} token\r * @param {(Graphic|Path|PathMath.Polygon)[]} others\r * @return {Graphic[]}\r */\rfunction getCollisions(token, others)\r```\r\r```\r/**\r * Returns the first token, from some list of tokens, that a token has\r * collided with during its last movement, or undfined if there was\r * no collision.\r * @param {Graphic} token\r * @param {(Graphic|Path|PathMath.Polygon)[]} others\r * @return {Graphic}\r */\rfunction getFirstCollision(token, others)\r```\r\r```\r/**\r * Checks if a non-moving token is currently overlapping another token.\r * This supports circular and rectangular tokens.\r * Tokens are considered to be rectangular if their aura1 is a square.\r * @param  {Graphic}  token\r * @param  {Graphic}  other\r * @param {boolean} [collideOnEdge=false]\r *        Whether tokens should count as overlapping even if they are only\r *        touching on the very edge.\r * @return {Boolean}\r */\rfunction isOverlapping(token, other, collideOnEdge)\r```\r\r## Help\r\rMy scripts are provided 'as-is', without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.\r\rThat said, if you experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,\rplease shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l\r\rWhen messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that\rappear in your API Console Log, any configurations you've got set up for the\rscript in the VTT, and any options you've got set up for the script on your\rgame's API Scripts page. The more information you provide me, the better the\rchances I'll be able to help.\r\r## Show Support\r\rIf you would like to show your appreciation and support for the work I do in writing,\rupdating, maintaining, and providing tech support my API scripts,\rplease consider buying one of my art packs from the Roll20 marketplace:\r\rhttps://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/publisher/165/ada-lindberg\r",
