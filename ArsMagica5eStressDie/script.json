    "description": "This allows players to enter '!st <number1>' or '!st <number1>, <number2>' (_nomod version: !st or !st <number2>) to roll a stress die with modifier <number1> and optional botch dice count <number2>. Botch dice count defaults to 1 when used with one argument. The _nomod version is designed for users who want to add their modifier separately. Multiple botches are possible, and will be reported in the case of a botch. Note that a result of 1 in the code corresponds to a result of zero in the text, and a 10 in the code is a 1 described in the corebook's text. This does not bias results, as both are special cases. Only results of 2-9 actually keep their numeric value. A macro for a stress die--modified or otherwise--can be easily made with syntax similar to !st ?{Modifier|0}, ?{Botch Dice|1}",
