  "description": " The GlitchCatcher is an API script that when added, will do its best
     to catch Shadowrun glitches. In Shadowrun, any pooled roll which contains
     more than half 1s is considered a glitch. In addition, if there are also
     no hits on the roll, it is considered a critical glitch. When detected
     glitches will be reported in the chat window.
      
     The script does its best to avoid non-pooled rolls, but isn't
     bulletproof. For instance, it avoids initiative rolls generated by any
     character sheet roll template that starts with 'sr' and whos content
     contains the string 'Initiative'.",
