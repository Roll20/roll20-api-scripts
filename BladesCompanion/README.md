# Blades in the Dark Companion Script

This is a helper script mainly intended to make it easy to synchronise data (stress, trauma, harm, clocks) between the tabletop and the character sheet. Enter **!blades** in chat to get started. By default, the script will automatically create clocks on the tabletop when a clock is created on the sheet; this can be turned off in the configuration (enter **!blades config-menu**).
