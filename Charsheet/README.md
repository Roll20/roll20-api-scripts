# CharacterSheet

A simple and easily customizable script allowing players to create their own
character sheets.

## Creating A Character Sheet

Just type:

`!charsheet`

This will generate an empty character. It will be viewable by everyone in the
campaign but only controllable by the player that ran the `!charsheet` command.

The character's name will default to `PLAYER_NAME #X`, where `X` is a sequential
number. In high-fatality games or multi-character funnels, this makes keeping
track of characters a little easier.

## Customizing

A GM with minimal scripting knowledge should be able to customize the script to
adapt to whatever game they are playing.

It's easy to change:
- sheet access permissions
- default character naming
- channel alert template
- default GM notes
