Easily keep tracks of who's turn it is, use a turn timer, let players progress to the next turn by themselves, adding/removing conditions, etc. It has a lot of customizable configuration options.  \n\n### StatusInfo\n\n If you use my [StatusInfo](https://github.com/RobinKuiper/Roll20APIScripts/tree/master/StatusInfo) script, it will also add the markers set there automatically to the selected token(s), and it will add a condition to this script if you manually (or through TokenMod/StatusInfo) set a marker that has a condition in StatusInfo.  ![Token](https://i.imgur.com/Pbca4fn.png \"Token\")  \n\n### Commands\n\n ![Menu](https://i.imgur.com/I1VJz91.png \"Menu\")  * **!ct** - Shows the CombatTracker menu. * **!ct config** - Shows the config menu. * **!ct favorites** - Shows the favorites menu. * **!ct start** - Starts the combat, if you have tokens selected it will try to roll initiative for them and add them to the tracker. * **!ct stop** - Stops the combat (closes the turntracker, removes the marker, clears the turnorder list, etc.). * **!ct next** - Goes to the next turn (a player can also use this if it is his turn). * **!ct prev** - Goes to the previous turn (gm only). * **!ct add [condition name] [?duration] [?direction] [?message]** - Adds a condition to the selected token(s) (duration is optionally (how much rounds.)).     * **[?duration]** - Optional duration, set `0` for no duration.     * **[?direction]** - The direction per turn, eg. `-1`, `-3`, `+1`, `+3`.     * **[?message]** - A message that will be visible. * **!ct remove [condition name]** - Removes a condition from the selected token(s). * **!ct reset conditions** - Resets all conditions. * **!ct st** - Stops the timer for this turn. * **!ct pt** - Pause timer toggle for this turn.  ### Favorites ![Favorites](https://i.imgur.com/nQqPpNJ.png \"Favorites\")  Here you can create, add and edit favorite conditions.
