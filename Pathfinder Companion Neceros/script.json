	"description": "# Companion API Script v1.X\nThe Pathfinder Companion Script automates many of the day to day tasks of playing in and running a pathfinder game. The script is designed for the Neceros Pathfinder Sheet for Roll20. Below is the quick reference guide. For more in depth information on what the script can do, how to use it, and upcoming features read the [user's manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12OWJIiT8RWN6zeyZdpkl3d8_DY7XLVxbVL9QzxyJV_s/edit?usp=sharing) on google drive. For questions, suggestions, bug reports, or general comments drop by the [script's forum thread](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/5412440/pf-pathfinder-companion-script-v1-dot-x-for-neceros-sheet/?pageforid=5412440#post-5412440).\n\nSheet compatibility: v1.6X [Neceros Pathfinder Sheet](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/4735667/pf-pathfinder-sheet-thread-6/?pagenum=1)\n\n###Configuration Options\n- **Automatically create token actions for macro menus:** Enabling this will automatically create the indicated abilities for all PCs and NPCs as they are created or made into NPCs. Enabling the setting adds a menu where you can specify what menus should be created for all characters categorized by PC or NPC.\n- **Automatic Resource Tracking:** Will create handling for automatically tracking ammo for weapons and spell, ability, and item usages.\n- **Automatically handle HP changes:** Enabling this will autodeduct damage from temporary hp before affecting HP. It will also prevent healing from occurring beyond the max HP of a character.\n- **Maintain PC default tokens:** Enabling this option will bring up a table to set what attribute (by case insensitive name) each bar should link to and whether that bar should be visible to players or not. Having this option turned on will also update the default token of a character whenever there is a change made to that character (excluding movement and var value/max changes). NOTE: With this setting enabled, setting a token to represent a character will update the bar links and values to be synced appropriately. This will not be reflected in the token setup pop-up until you reload the menu. Exit the menu by hitting **CANCEL** (NOT **APPLY**) and your token will be set as the default token for that character and setup as per the settings in the config menu.\n- **Apply Condition/Buff statusmarkers:** Enabling this will apply the appropriate statusmarker to all tokens representing the buffed/conditioned character if that character is controlled by at least one player. You can designate statusmarkers to use for buffs on a per character basis by using the **!pfc --buffstatus** command while you have a single token selected or by passing a single character id after (e.g. **!pfc --buffstatus|@{Jord Strongbow|character_id}**). NOTE this setting will not work correctly unless Maintain PC default tokens is enabled\n###Current macro setup, auto attribute handling and command syntax:\n####Automatic Attribute Handling\n\n- **HP & Temp HP:** If this option is enabled in the config menu health deducted from a character's HP will be deducted from their temp hp first before being applied to their HP. Note this will not work with API applied HP changes (other than those caused by this script).\nMacro Setup\n\n- **Weapons:** Weapons can be setup to track ammo usage (according to # of attacks used, including usage of manyshot), other item usage, spell usage, ability usage, and custom attribute usage.\nAmmo Tracking: Setting the ammo field of a weapon to anything besides 1 tells the script that that weapon uses ammo. The script willgenerate the following field in the macro text of the weapon: ||ammo=?{Name of Ammunition Item}||. After the first time you answer this query, it will be replaced with your response.You can also manually put a different query in here to be prompted for what ammunition to use with each attack routine.\n- **Spell or Ability Tracking:** If a weapon is linked to a spell or ability (that has uses), an additional roll template field will be added to the macro that will display a button to outputthe spell card as well as buttons to increment, decrement, or custom adjust the number of spells used.\nSpells: A field similar to that for weapons linked to a spell will be added to all spells.\n- **Abilities:** A field similar to that for weapons linked to an ability will be added to all abilities that have uses.\ncustom attribute: Entering %%What you named the custom attribute%% into the description field (notes field for weapons) will cause the script to put a field similar to the spell or ability to allow you to adjust the quantity of it. This will only be created for those custom attributes that have a current/max comparison. This can also be used to add fields for spells,abilities, or items without having to directly edit the macro text.\nCommand syntax\n\n- **Item tracking:** !pfc --resource,item=Item Name,current=max OR +/-X OR X,max=+/-X OR X|characterid|characterid|...\n- **Ability tracking:** !pfc --resource,ability=Ability Name,current=max OR +/-X OR X|characterid|characterid|...\n- **Spell tracking:** !pfc --resource,spell=Spell Name,current=max OR +/-X OR X|characterid|characterid|...\n- **Custom Attribute tracking:** !pfc --resource,note=Custom Attribute Name,current=max OR +/-X OR X|characterid|characterid|...\n- **Whisper Adjusting:** !pfc --whisper,npc=public/private/swap,pc=public/private/swap,stats=public/private/swap|characerid|characterid|...\nAccess the Config Menu: !pfc --config\n- **Apply/Remove Buffs Conditions:** !pfc --apply,condition=all or part of a condtion name,buff=all or part of a buff name that has already been setup on the character,remove/swap|characterid|characterid|...\n- **Import Statblock:** !pfc --parse|characterid|characterid|characterid| OR !pfc --parse|{{statblock NEWCREATURE statblock NEW CREATURE ...}}\nCopy your statblock (pure text only - copy into a text editor first to clean off formatting) into the gmnotes of a fresh character or directly via chat, and then run the command. I have only tested the parser on pfsrd statblocks (and not many of those) so far, and hope to overcome the issues preventing multiple statblocks from being imported at once, as well as hopefully eventually allowing statblocks to be imported from chat.\nBuff statusmarker wizard: !pfc --buffstatus|characterid\nThe characterid is optional if you have a token representing a character selected. The command only works on a single character; having more than one token selected or passing more than one character id will only act on the first character in the list (this is unpredictable when using selected tokens).",
