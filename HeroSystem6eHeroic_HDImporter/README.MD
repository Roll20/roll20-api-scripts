# Hero System 6e Heroic: HD Importer
A script for importing characters built in or acquired for HERO Designer into a Roll20 Hero System 6e Heroic game. 

*HD Importer* attempts to translate as much of a [HERO Designer](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/1-hero-designer/) character as possible into a Roll20 [HeroSystem6eHeroic](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/blob/master/HeroSystem6eHeroic/README.md) character sheet. There will invariably be rules, options, or build styles that do not translate well from HERO Designer into Roll20. Nonetheless, this importer should import most of the details of a character. 

This script was tested with the following commercially available character packs (more than 700 characters):
- [Champions Begins (free)](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/1005-champions-begins-pdfhd/)
- [Dead Orc Pass](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/910-dead-orc-pass-mini-campaign-book-pdfhdc/)

- [Fantasy Hero 6th Edition Character Pack](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/59-fantasy-hero-6th-edition-character-pack/)
- [Fistful of Fu: Real World Martial Artists](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/1015-fistful-of-fu-real-world-martial-artists-pdf-hdc/)

- [Monster Hunter International](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/5-monster-hunter-international-character-pack/)
- [Narosia HERO Designer Pack](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/544-narosia-hero-designer-character-pack/)

# Installation:

From the campaign's home page go to the Mods page via 'Settings -> Mod (API) Scripts.'

From the Mods page select 'HeroSystem6eHeroic HDImporter' from the Mod Library dropdown list. Version 2.4 is the most recent and recommended version. Alternatively, create a new script and copy and paste the contents of HeroSystem6eHeroic_HDImporter.js into the text editing box. Save the script.

Launch the game.

If *HD Importer* has started correctly the following notification should appear in chat when your Roll20 campaign starts up for the first time:
![HelpMenu](/HeroSystem6eHeroic_HDImporter/images/ScriptReady.png)

# Import a Character:

## HERO Designer
1. Download the latest export format file [HeroSystem6eHeroic.hde](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts/blob/master/HeroSystem6eHeroic_HDImporter/2.1/HeroSystem6eHeroic.hde) from this repository and install it into your HERO Designer folder.
2. Create a new character or load a character file into HERO Designer.
3. Select the export format HeroSystem6eHeroic.hde via the menu item "Current Character->Export->Set Export Format..."
4. Select "Current Character->Export->Export to File..." to save the character as a .txt file.
5. If the character has a profile image, save that as well.

## Text Editor
1. Open the exported character file in your favorite text editor (with some exceptions discussed below).
2. Copy the entire contents (with cmd-A or ctrl-A).

## Roll20
1. Paste the copied text into the chat window of your Roll20 HeroSystem6eHeroic game.
2. Hit enter. If all goes well you should see a start and finish notification, which for the character "Alena" appears as
![HelpMenu](/HeroSystem6eHeroic_HDImporter/images/ImportSuccess.png)
3. (Optional) Open the new Roll20 character and click the `Edit` button in the upper right corner of the window to apply the character's profile image file.

## Sample Characters
The [release folder](/HeroSystem6eHeroic_HDImporter/2.4/) contains four test and evaluation characters for use in HERO Designer (HDC) and Roll20 (TXT).
- `Sample_Character.hdc` is the fae wizard *Darci*.
- `Sample_Character_MA.hdc` is the doctor and martial arts swordsman *Henkle*.
- `Sample_Vehicle_APC.hdc` is the near-future armored personnel carrier *Chariot*.
- `Sample_Vehicle_BB.hdc` is the time machine *Blue Box*.

## Vehicles
While twenty powers is typically sufficient for most heroic characters, it is easy to create vehicles with far more, particularly for science-fiction settings. Sensors, life support systems, and the like can really add up. To avoid running out of space, I suggest following the Star HERO source book's examples, which use Variable Power Pools for sensors and other systems. Some powers can easily be described as custom talents or skills as well. See the sample character file Sample_Vehicle_BB.hdc in this repository. 

If you want to import more details to your vehicle sheets, consider defining various system powers as equipment. These will be imported as sheet equipment in the gear section, with power details printed in the adjacent text box.

Another point to make about vehicles is that *HD Importer* ignores the default ground and swimming movement attributes. The sheet refunds these movement attributes by default. That said, HD Importer will count these starting values in the total movement value of ground or swimming powers if added to a vehicle.

## General Notes
Try to avoid double quotation marks, which JSON files use for data values. If you would like to use quotation marks in your Hero Designer files, consider using single quotes instead. During the export process, Hero Designer will attempt to fix errant double quotes, but it may not catch them all.

Characters exported with older versions of HeroSystem6eHeroic.hde (1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3) will work, but those exported with the latest version (2.4) will have more content and may benefit from bug fixes. Version 2.4 is the first to support vehicles.

Hero Designer has entries for eye color and hair color. This information is not imported since the character sheet does not have corresponding fields.

Attack powers and resistant defense powers will be imported as powers *and* as weapons and armor on the gear page. This feature is useful for vehicles, monsters, and superheroic characters that don't rely on equipment.

*HD Importer* attempts to fill in the appropriate spaces in the sheet with the items it can identify, but HERO items often have additional information to track. Details on weapons, armor, and other equipment appear in the text field in the "Gear" page. 

At present, the character sheet has twenty power, ten talent, and ten complication slots. Up to thirty additional powers and ten talents and complications, if found, will be imported as text and displayed in sheet notes fields. None of these overflow items will count in the sheet's automatic character point calculations.

Powers that add (or subtract) characteristics, movement, and perception abilities should be applied in the appropriate modifier fields.

> [!TIP]
> *HD Importer* will recognize the following keywords and phrases if added to power and equipment notes and attempts to automatically apply the values given.

- `(locations x-y, z) or (loc x, y-z)` : If *HD Importer* finds the keyword "locations" it will assign the list "x-y, z" to a piece of armor's locations. End the list with closed parentheses ")" or a semicolon ";".

- `Max Range: XYZm or max range XYZ` : *HD Importer* will fill in a weapon's maximum range with XYZ.

- `X END/Turn or END/Turn: X` : If your campaign uses the optional rule of applying END costs to armor, *HD Importer* will automatically apply the value X.

- `(Equipment)` : An item or power with the "(Equipment)" keyword will be imported to the Gear Page as a piece of equipment, not armor or as a weapon. Useful for ordinary items built with attack powers.

- `(Ignore)` : An item or power with the "(Ignore)" keyword will not be imported to the Gear Page.

# Troubleshooting Import Errors

Notepad++ and potentially other text editors may convert double quotes to pairs of single quotes. Try using your app's search function to see if pairs of single quotes exist in your character files. If they do exist, please use another text editor. Thank you to Jim E. for reporting this issue.
