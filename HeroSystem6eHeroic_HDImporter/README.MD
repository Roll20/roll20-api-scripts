# Hero System 6e Heroic: HD Importer
A script for importing characters built in or acquired for HERO Designer into a Roll20 Hero System 6e Heroic game. 

HD Importer attempts to translate as much of a [HERO Designer](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/1-hero-designer/) character as possible into a Roll20 [HeroSystem6eHeroic](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/blob/master/HeroSystem6eHeroic/README.md) character sheet. There will invariably be rules, options, or build styles that do not translate well from HERO Designer into Roll20. Nonetheless, this importer should import most of the details of a character. 

This script was tested with the following commercially available character packs (almost 700 character files):
- [Champions Begins (free)](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/1005-champions-begins-pdfhd/)
- [Dead Orc Pass](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/910-dead-orc-pass-mini-campaign-book-pdfhdc/)
- [Dragon Bestiary 01 - Black Dragon](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/1080-dragon-bestiary-01-black-dragon-pdfhdc/)
- [Extinction Event: Hero Designer Pack](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/1045-extinction-event-hero-designer-pack/)
- [Fantasy Hero 6th Edition Character Pack](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/59-fantasy-hero-6th-edition-character-pack/)
- [Fistful of Fu: Real World Martial Artists](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/1015-fistful-of-fu-real-world-martial-artists-pdf-hdc/)
- [HERO System Bestiary 6th Edition Character Pack](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/79-hero-system-bestiary-6th-edition-character-pack/)
- [HERO System Martial Arts Character Pack](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/85-hero-system-martial-arts-character-pack/)
- [Kazei 5](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/92-kazei-5-character-pack/)
- [Monster Hunter International](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/5-monster-hunter-international-character-pack/)
- [Narosia HERO Designer Pack](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/544-narosia-hero-designer-character-pack/)
- [One-Sheet Encounters - Fallen Angel](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/1044-one-sheet-encounters-fallen-angel-pdf/)
- [Villainy Codex IV](https://www.herogames.com/store/product/898-villainy-codex-iv-â€“-arcana-whero-designer-files-zip/)

# Installation:

From the campaign's home page go to the Mods page via 'Settings -> Mod (API) Scripts.'

From the Mods page select 'HeroSystem6eHeroic HDImporter' from the Mod Library dropdown list. Version 2.1 is the most recent and recommended version. Alternatively, create a new script and copy and paste the contents of HeroSystem6eHeroic_HDImporter.js into the text editing box. Save the script.

Launch the game.

If HD Importer has started correctly the following notification should appear in chat when your Roll20 campaign starts up for the first time:
![HelpMenu](/HeroSystem6eHeroic_HDImporter/images/ScriptReady.png)

# Import a Character:

## HERO Designer
1. Download the latest export format file [HeroSystem6eHeroic.hde](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts/blob/master/HeroSystem6eHeroic_HDImporter/2.1/HeroSystem6eHeroic.hde) from this repository and install it into your HERO Designer folder.
2. Create a new character or load a character file into HERO Designer.
3. Select the export format HeroSystem6eHeroic.hde via the menu item "Current Character->Export->Set Export Format..."
4. Select "Current Character->Export->Export to File..." to save the character as a .txt file.
5. If the character has a profile image, save that as well.

## Text Editor
1. Open the exported character file in your favorite text editor (with some exceptions discussed below).
2. Copy the entire contents (with cmd-A or ctrl-A).

## Roll20
1. Paste the copied text into the chat window of your Roll20 HeroSystem6eHeroic game.
2. Hit enter. If all goes well you should see a start and finish notification, which for the character "Alena" appears as
![HelpMenu](/HeroSystem6eHeroic_HDImporter/images/ImportSuccess.png)

## Sample Character
The release folder contains two sample character files:
- `Sample_Character.hdc` is a Hero Designer character, which you may use with Hero Designer for testing and evaluation.
- `Sample_Character.txt` is the same character exported from Hero Designer using HeroSystem6eHeroic.hde as the export format. 

## Notes
Double quotation marks are used to indicate JSON data values. Please take care to avoid quotation marks in Hero Designer text fields. Instead use single quotes. The exporter will attempt to remove double quotes, but this may not be foolproof.

Characters exported with the older version of HeroSystem6eHeroic.hde (1.0 and 2.0) should work, but version 2.1 supports more content and has fixes for bugs present in the earlier versions.

Hero Designer has entries for eye color and hair color. This information is not imported since the character sheet does not have corresponding fields.

Weapons, armor, and other equipment are imported as text and shown in the text field in the "Gear" page. HD Importer attempts to fill in the appropriate spaces in the sheet with the items it can identify, but HERO items often have additional information to track. Expect this area to require some degree of human attention.

At present, the character sheet has twenty power, ten talent, and ten complication slots. Ten additional entries of each type, if found, will be imported as text and displayed in sheet notes fields. None of the these overflow items will count in the sheet's automatic character point calculations.

Powers that add (or subtract) characteristics, movement, and perception abilities should be applied in the appropriate modifier fields.

If your campaign uses the optional rule of applying END costs to armor, HD Importer will recognize (X END/Turn) or (END/Turn: X) in equipment notes.

# Help

# Configuration Options

The configuration menu is accessible from the Help Screen or via the chat window command "!hero --config". HD Importer offers a number of options to help organize imported characters and to pre-configure campaign options.

![HelpMenu](/HeroSystem6eHeroic_HDImporter/images/ConfigMenu.png)

- `Suffix` : Adds a text label to the end of an imported character's name.
- `In Player Journal` : Presets the imported character's visibility to players.
- `Player Control` : Presets the player control assigned to the imported character.
- `Use Char Maximums` : Presets the sheet option that figures characteristic maximums into point costs.

- `Super-Heroic END` : Presets the option for lower endurance costs for strength.
- `Use Hit Locations` : Presets the sheet option to determine hit locations.

# Troubleshooting Import Errors

Notepad++ and potentially other text editors may convert double quotes to pairs of single quotes. Check to see if pairs of single quotes exist in your character files. If they do exist, consider using another text editor or try replacing them with double quotes. Thank you to Jim E. for reporting this issue.
