Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.\nAreas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\nSpells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\nMagic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere.

Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.\nCreatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.\nDispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere.

For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers).

Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.\nIf the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.\nThe wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.\nIf you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.\nThe wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.\nIf you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled.

By simply by speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality as you wish.\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n- You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.\n- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\n- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.\n- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.","emote":"wishes for {{GENDER_PRONOUN_HIS_HER}} deepest desire"},{"name":"Witch Bolt","level":1,"school":"Evocation","castingTime":"1 action","range":"30 feet","components":{"verbal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true,"materialMaterial":"a twig from a tree that has been struck by lightning"},"concentration":true,"duration":"up to 1 minute","description":"A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target.

	 * @typedef {Object} FieldSpec
	 * @property {FieldSpec[]} [contentModel] - list of child fieldSpecs for complex content
	 * @property {boolean} [bare] - if true this field appears as a bare value with no parseToken in front of it
	 * @property {string} [parseToken] - the token that defines the beginning of this field (usually case insensitive). Not
	 *   used for bare tokens.
	 * @property {string} [pattern] - a pattern that defines the value of this field. For bare properties this will
	 *   determine if the field matches at all, whereas for normal ones this will just be used to validate them
	 * @property {number} [forNextMatchGroup] - the 1-based index of the match group from the supplied pattern that will
	 *   contain text that should be handed to the next parser rather than used as part of this field.
	 * @property {number} [forPreviousMatchGroup] - the 1-based index of the match group from the supplied pattern that
	 *   will contain text that should be handed to the previous parser to complete its value rather than used as part of
	 *   this field. Only applicable to bare properties, since ones with a token have a clearly defined start based on the
	 *   parseToken
	 * @property {number} [matchGroup=0] - the index of the capturing group in the supplied pattern to use as the value for
	 *   this field. If left at the default of 0, the whole match will be used.
	 * @property {boolean} [caseSensitive=false] - If true, the pattern used for the value of this field will be made case
	 *   sensitive. Note that parseToken matching is always case insensitive.
	 * @property {string} type - the type of this field. Currently valid values are [orderedContent, unorderedContent,
	 *   string, enumType, integer, abililty]
	 * @property {string[]} enumValues - an array of valid values for this field if the type is enumType
	 * @property {number} [minOccurs=1] - the minimum number of times this field should occur in the parent content model.
	 * @property {number} [maxOccurs=1] - the maximum number of times this field should occur in the parent content model.
