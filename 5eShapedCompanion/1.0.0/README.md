### Samples and Custom JSON
If you are interested in adding custom JSON for homebrew spells/monsters then you first of all need to create the correct JSON.
Have a look at the .json files in the samples directory to get an idea of the format. Once you have the correct JSON, you need
to wrap it in a little bit of javascript to actually register the new spells/monsters with the script. See the customMonsterAndSpellsSample.js
in the samples directory for an example of how this is done.
