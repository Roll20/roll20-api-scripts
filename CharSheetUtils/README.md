# Character Sheet Utils

This script provides a collection of utility functions for reading and writing
attributes from a character sheet, including support for attributes in
repeating sections and calculated attributes. This script does nothing on
its own. It is a helper library meant to be used by other scripts.

Full documentation for the functions provided by this script are given
in the jsdoc annotations in the source code.
