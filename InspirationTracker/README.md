InspirationTracker keeps track of inspiration and adds a statusmarker to the characters token(s). You can also easily give an inspiration with the command `!inspiration` when you have token(s) selected.
Works great with my [StatusInfo](https://github.com/RobinKuiper/Roll20APIScripts/tree/master/StatusInfo) script.

### Commands

* **!inspiration** - Gives an inspiration to selected token(s), or shows the config menu when nothing is selected.
* **!inspiration config** - Shows the config menu.
