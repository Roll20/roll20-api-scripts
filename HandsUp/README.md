# Hands Up

Do you have players in your game who are shy, soft-spoken, or otherwise have
trouble speaking over the other players? This script will extend the
accessibility of your game by allowing players to raise their hand to get your
attention when they want to speak.

This script installs a macro named 'Raise Hand', which when pressed will cause
the player's icon color to flash in order to get the GM's attention. The player
can later lower their hand by simply pressing the same macro again.

_WARNING: This script displays animations of color in small portions of the screen,
which may be harmful to some photosensitive people. By using this script, you
agree to not hold its author liable for any epileptic events it may cause.
Please use the dance mat in a well-lit area with plenty of space.
Enjoy the script!_
