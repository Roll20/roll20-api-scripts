The Sector Generator allows the GM to generate a sector. 

Just type !sector-generate in the chat window.

The results are determined by artifacts, environements, and threats from the core Mutant Year Zero book.

There are a couple of custom artifacts that you can replace once you paste the script into the roll20 script
window if you'd like to customize the results to your campaign. These artifacts are detailed at https;//www.smokeraven.com/mutant-year-zero-sector-generator
if you would like to use them in your game.

There are a couple of settlements in the settlements array that are not in the core rules but are in
the campaign of the script author. You change or remove these to reflect the special sectors in your 
campaign.

Other game materials can be found at https://www.smokeraven.com and any issues with the script can be
addressed in the github repo or email raven@smokeraven.com.
