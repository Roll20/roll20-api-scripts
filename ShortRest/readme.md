Allows Hit Dice, Class Resource and Spellslot tracking for Short Rests on the 5e OGL Character Sheet.

The script can be used in 2 ways, either by clicking on Hit Dice on the 5e OGL Sheet or by selecting a token and running the `!shortrest-nohd` command (if you want to do a short rest without expending any Hit Dice.) The script will then check if you have any Hit Die to spend, if you aren't already full health it will update the character's health with the rolled amount. Further to this it will check whether the class has any resources or spell slots that resets on a short rest and reset those.
