    "description": "**PowerCards** allows you to define highly customizable templated output for PC and NPC actions, spells, abilities, statistics, or almost any other purpose you can come up with. See also the **PowerCards Macro Helper** API, which is a companion script to PowerCards.\n\n * [PowerCard Documentation](https://wiki.roll20.net/Script:PowerCards)\n* [PowerCards forum thread](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/7136858/script-powercards-3-thread-6) \n\nThe API's original purpose was to present ability and attack information (powers) in a format similar to the power blocks from the official D&D 4E products, but the format works well for any system. PowerCards are output to the chat window with full HTML/CSS formatting. A handful of options use information from the **D&D 5E by Roll20** sheet, but these options are not critical to the functioning of the core features of the script.",
