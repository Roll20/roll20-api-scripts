    "description": "The InitMaster API supports initiative for RPGs using the Turn Order and the Tracker window.  It provides functions dealing with all aspects of: managing how initiative is done; rolling for initiative; for 'group' and 'individual' initiative types providing Character action selection to determine the speed and number of attacks of weapons, the casting time of spells & the usage speed of magic items; supporting initiative for multiple attacks with one or multiple weapons per round; supporting and tracking actions that take multiple rounds; managing the resulting Turn Order; as well as performing the 'End of Day' activity.  It works very closely with the RoundMaster API to the extent that InitiativeMaster cannot work without RoundMaster (though the reverse is possible).  InitiativeMaster also works closely with AttackMaster API and MagicMaster API and uses the data configured on the Character Sheet by these other APIs, although it can use manually completed Character Sheets once correctly configured.\n[InitMaster Documentation](https://wiki.roll20.net/Script:InitMaster) \n\n### Related APIs\nThis API works best with the RPGMaster series of APIs, and requires RoundMaster API to work (loaded automatically on One-Click install)\n[RPGMaster Documentation](https://wiki.roll20.net/RPGMaster)\n\n### Getting Started\n* If using with CommandMaster API, use the `!cmd --initialise` command to install the DMs Macro Quick Bar buttons, or\n* If not using CommandMaster API, as a Macro in the DM's macro quick bar, add the command `!init --maint` to manage RoundMaster functions\n* Add the command `!init --menu` as an Ability Macros on Character Sheets of Characters, NPCs & Monsters that will use the API, and tick 'Show as Token Action'.  These menus will then be available to Players controlling those sheets and give access to all common commands used in game-play.",
