  "description": "# Calendar\n\nThis simple script is used to help keep track of the current in-game date for your game. It was designed to be extremely simple to use and update.\n\nIt currently supports 4 calendars:\n\n- **gregorian** - the calendar used in (most of) the real world.\n- **harptos** - the calendar used in the Forgotten Realms (12 months of 30 days, with 5 extra days between months and a sixth extra day every 4 years).\n- **barovian** - the lunar calendar used in Barovia (12 months of 28 days).\n- **golarion** - the Golarion calendar used in Pathfinder (similar to the Gregorian calendar with different names, but leap years are every 8 years)\n\n## Setup\n\nOnce this script is installed in your game, setup is easy.\n\nFirst, set the type of calendar you want to use (in this example, I'll use harptos):\n\n```\n!cal type harptos\n```\n\nSecondly, set the date, which goes `day month year`:\n\n```\n!cal set 20 1 1491\n```\n\nSince the harptos calendar has days that fall between months, you can also use the name of that day and the year:\n\n```\n!cal set midsummer 1490\n!cal set feastofthemoon 1490\n!cal set Feast of the Moon 1490\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce the calendar has been set up, it's pretty easy to use.\n\n\n**Display**\n\nTo see the current date (this command is available to everyone):\n\n```\n!cal\n```\n\n**Increment Day**\n\nTo make the calendar go to the next day (GM only command), use:\n\n```\n!cal next\n```\n\n**Decrement Day**\n\nIf you incremented the day by accident or too many times, you can always go back (GM only command) using this:\n\n```\n!cal previous\n```\n\n## Full API\n\n**Calendar Version 1.2**\n\n\n```\n!cal\n```\n\n*(everyone)* Displays the current in-game date.\n\n*Aliased by: ``!cal display``*\n\n---\n\n```\n!cal next\n```\n\n*(GM)* Advances the in-game date by 1 day.\n\n*Aliased by: `!cal ++`, `!cal increment`*\n\n---\n\n```\n!cal add [number of days]\n```\n\n*(GM)* Advances the in-game date by a given number of days.\n\n- [number of days] (integer (positive)) - the number of days to advance the date by\n\n*Aliased by: `!cal += [number of days]`, `!cal set +[number of days]`*\n \n\n---\n\n```\n!cal subtract [number of days]\n```\n\n*(GM)* Decreases the in-game date by a given number of days.\n\n- [number of days] (integer (positive)) - the number of days to decrease the date by\n\n*Aliased by: `!cal -= [number of days]`, `!cal set -[number of days]`*\n \n\n---\n\n```\n!cal previous\n```\n\n*(GM)* Regresses the in-game date by 1 day.\n\n*Aliased by: `!cal --`, `!cal prev`, `!cal decrement`*\n \n\n---\n\n```\n!cal system\n```\n\n*(everyone)* Displays the current calendar system.\n\n*Aliased by: `!cal type`*\n \n\n---\n\n```\n!cal system [system]\n```\n\n*(GM)* Sets the current calendar system.
