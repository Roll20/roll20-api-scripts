	"description": "# Supernotes\r*This was about 25% written by keithcurtis, adapted from code written by the Aaron.*\r\rThis script pulls the contents from a token's GM Notes field and sends them to chat, based on a user-selectable roll template. If the token represents a character, you can optionally pull in the Bio or GM notes from the character. The user can decide whether to whisper the notes to the GM or broadcast them to all players. Finally, there is the option to add a footer to notes whispered to the GM. This footer creates a chat button to give the option of sending the notes on to the players.\r\rThis script as written is optimized for the D&D 5th Edition by Roll20 sheet, but can be adapted easily suing the Configuration section below.\r\r\r## Commands:\r\r**!gmnote** whispers the note to the GM\r\r**!pcnote** sends the note to all players\r\r\r## Paramaters\r\r*--token* Pulls notes from the selected token's gm notes field. This is optional. If it is missing, the script assumes --token\r\r*--charnote* Pulls notes from the gm notes field of the character assigned to a token.\r\r*--bio* Pulls notes from the bio field of the character assigned to a token.\r\r*--avatar* Pulls the image from the avatar field of the character assigned to a token.\r\r*--image* Pulls first image from the bio field of the character assigned to a token, if any exists. Otherwise returns notice that no artwork is available\r\r*--help* Displays help.\r\r*--config* Returns a configuration dialog box that allows you to set which sheet's roll template to use, and to toggle the '\r Players' footer.\r\r\r## Configuration\r\rWhen first installed, Supernotes is configured for the default roll template. It will display a config dialog box at startup that will allow you to choose a roll template based on your character sheet of choice, as well as the option  to toggle whether you want the '\r Players' footer button to appear.\r\rYou will need to edit the code of the script if you wish to create a custom configuration, or contact keithcurtis on the Roll20 forum and request an addition. The pre-installed sheets are:\r\rDefault Template, D&D 5th Edition by Roll20, 5e Shaped, Pathfinder by Roll20, Pathfinder Community, Pathfinder 2e by Roll20, Starfinder",
